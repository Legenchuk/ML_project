Russian coronavirus aid delivery to US prompts confusion and criticism,"Washington (CNN)Former State Department officials were ""mystified"" and ""bemused"" by the United States' purchase of medical supplies from Russia amid the coronavirus pandemic -- a move that experts say is a propaganda win for the Kremlin.CNN's Maegan Vazquez and Betsy Klein in Washington, Mary Ilyushina in Moscow and Matthew Chance in London contributed to this report. A Russian plane with the equipment touched down in New York City on Wednesday, with an air traffic controller thanking the pilot ""for all the assistance you are bringing in."" The delivery came days after  President Donald Trump spoke by phone with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin.  'A very nice offer' According to State Department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus, the US purchased the supplies, which included ventilators and personal protection equipment.  ""Both countries have provided humanitarian assistance to each other in times of crisis in the past and will no doubt do so again in the future,"" she said. ""This is a time to work together to overcome a common enemy that threatens the lives of all of us.""  A State Department spokesperson on Thursday evening said, ""The United States is purchasing the supplies and equipment outright, as with deliveries from other countries.""  ""We appreciate Russia selling these items to us below market value,"" they said.  It is unclear if the Trump administration also bought supplies from other countries below market value, and how this specific deal was established.  The spokesperson for the Russian Foreign Ministry, Maria Zakharova, said Thursday that half of the cargo was paid for by the Russian Direct Investment Fund -- a state-owned sovereign wealth investment fund -- and half by the US.  Trump, speaking from the White House Thursday, did not mention the supplies being purchased. He instead touted the delivery as ""a very nice offer"" and said he would be open to future aid. ""It was a very nice gesture on behalf of President Putin and I could have said 'no, thank you' or I could have said 'thank you.' And it was a large plane of very high-quality medical supplies. And I said, 'I'll take it,'"" Trump said. 'Hard to understand why they are not being clear' The decision to buy supplies from one of the US' traditional adversaries -- and the lack of transparency around that choice -- was met with confusion by a number of former officials.  ""Maybe this is a case of the bureaucracy being worried and having to fill in behind a decision Trump made on his own, but not wanting to get too far into the details to avoid backlash,"" said one of the former officials. The other official struggled to find any sort of justification for the Trump administration allowing Russia to be a trusted source for the goods, which are in short supply in the United States. ""It is really hard to understand why they are not being clear. It should be easy to explain,"" they said. ""It also highlights the issues with how much aid the US is giving to other countries and how much is coming in."" Russia is subject to numerous US sanctions, including for its aggression in Ukraine and its attempts to interfere in the 2016 US election. Daniel Fried, a former diplomat specializing in Russia and sanctions policy, told CNN that ""it shows the complexity of dealing, in a humanitarian area, with Russian institutions when we are pushing back at the same time against their aggressions.""  'Propaganda bonanza' Former diplomat Brett McGurk described the delivery, which was touted by Moscow as a humanitarian gesture, as a ""propaganda bonanza.""  Graham Brookie, the Director and Managing Editor of the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab, told CNN that they're seeing ""a huge amount of that kind of 'Russia is here to help,' that positive messaging, positive propaganda."" ""The Russians will fly in as many planes as possible to create the perception that we are reliant on Russia,"" a third former official said. ""If we keep accepting it, this makes us look weak and them look strong."" Andrew Weiss, the Vice President for Studies in the Russia and Eurasia Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said the move played into Russia's broader foreign policy goals. ""There's this constant effort to basically say that anything the West might be concerned about is unfounded,"" he told CNN. ""In many respects, the Russian handling of Donald Trump has taken on aspects of trolling, where they're using Trump's attempts to turn the page to push core elements of Russia's foreign policy view, which is US policy is a joke,"" Weiss said. ""I think it's just one more of these incidents that we've seen where the Russians outfoxed the Trump White House."" "
"Even in the coronavirus pandemic, the Japanese likely won't stay home until Shinzo Abe makes them","Tokyo (CNN)Salary men in suits crammed into trains during the rush-hour commute are staple scenes in Tokyo. CNN's Junko Ogura, Sophie Jeong and Michelle Toh contributed to this report. Up until a few weeks ago, 52-year-old Hideya Tokiyoshi, who traveled into the capital from neighboring Saitama prefecture for work each day, was among them.  The English-language teacher moved to online lessons after his students grew anxious over the coronavirus pandemic, which has killed more than 46,800 people globally, according to the Johns Hopkins University.  Tokiyoshi, however, is a rare case.  While Tokyo's governor Yuriko Koike has urged the city's 13.5 million residents to telework where possible until April 12, and major Japanese companies such as Honda, Toyota and Nissan have asked staff to work from home, many employees are still commuting into the capital, where subway trains are busy during rush hour.  It's a similar story all across Japan, where about 80% of companies do not have the ability to let their employees telework, according to 2019 government data.  And with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe this week declining to declare a state of emergency, which would put pressure on businesses to enforce social distancing, companies can still legally operate from their offices. Underpinning this is Japan's notorious hard-work culture. A 2016 government study found that one in five employees was at risk of working themselves to death. The country even has its own word for it: ""karoshi,"" or death by overwork, which is defined as employees working so hard that they die from stress-related diseases -- or become so depressed that they kill themselves. ""The (coronavirus) information is on our mind and we're scared more than you would expect,"" tweeted Tokiyoshi recently. ""But for average Japanese, work is always the highest priority and the biggest excuse.  ""Unless (the) government shuts all businesses down with a few exemptions, no one will stay at home. We're slaves to work."" Exposing old habits The now-delayed Tokyo 2020 Olympics were meant to showcase Japan as a high-tech nation with robots showing guests to their seats and artificial meteorites in the sky. In reality, often people are wedded to more traditional ways of conducting business.  The fax machine, for example, remains a fixture in many offices, and people still use the company stamp to give official documents a seal of approval. In Japan, personal and company stamps are often used instead of electronic or handwritten signatures.  During the pandemic, many multinational companies have turned to messaging and video conferencing software such as Slack, Webex and Zoom to keep in touch with colleagues. But Rochelle Kopp, a business consultant at Japan Intercultural Consulting who has worked between Japan and the US for more than three decades, says Japanese firms have not made sufficient IT investments to do this.  Many employees don't have laptops they can take home, Kopp said, and companies do not have VPNs or remote access to their servers, meaning things can only be accessed in person at the office. To accelerate change as the coronavirus crisis continues, Japan's Ministry of Labor is offering grants of up to $77,000 to help small and medium-sized companies prepare for teleworking, said Misaki Togoshi, a spokeswoman at the Japanese Teleworking Association.  Nevertheless, barriers remain. ""We've started receiving up to 25 applications a day since March 9 from companies that want to adopt teleworking practices, but the funding is finite so not everyone will receive it,"" Togoshi said.     Another barrier is that a quarter of Japan's population is aged 65 and over. Many still occupy senior positions and are not known for being tech savvy. In 2018, for example, the country's then 68-year-old cybersecurity minister admitted he had never used a computer in his professional life.   ""Even if the hardware became available, older people may not have the experience or knowledge to adapt quickly,"" said Hisakazu Kato, a professor of economics at Meiji University in Tokyo. ""There's a clear digital divide in Japan.""     Face-to-face work culture   The reluctance to close offices and work remotely speaks to Japan's intense work culture, where employees are expected to put in long hours.  ""Some workers will stay at the office after hours because they think that the boss may be coming back after dinner with his associates,"" said Jesper Koll, a Japan-based economist and financial strategist. ""All of this is very real part of Japanese corporate culture."" The cultural emphasis on collective decision-making in Japan can also make people feel reluctant to work from home, where they will not be physically surrounded by colleagues. ""The situation in Japan is a bit unique compared to other countries where people have a more individualistic work style. It's easier for them to transition to teleworking,"" Kato said. ""In Japan, one person can't make an important decision alone at their home -- people have to come together to make decisions."" In many places, governments have led by example. In Hong Kong, for instance, the government announced that civil servants would work from home when it asked private businesses to let employees work remotely. Japan has not done that. While some government employees are teleworking, many are still going into the office.   Nakane Tsuyoshi, a human resources officer at the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare in Tokyo, is going to work, although the ministry has staggered the arrival times of staff, with some starting at 8 a.m. and others at 10 a.m.. ""We would worry that we can't help people and get the job done properly if we worked worked from home,"" he said.   At the Tokyo Metropolitan Government, workers dealing with the coronavirus pandemic, the delayed Olympics and those answering calls from the public are still going to the office, according to a spokesman.     Service industry More than 70% of Japan's workforce was also employed in the service sector in 2019, according to Japan's Bureau of Statistics. For those workers, it is near impossible to telework, Kato said.  Haru, who works as a massage therapist in a mall in Tokyo, still catches a bus to work. But now many customers are canceling their reservations, especially since 78 people tested positive for coronavirus in the capital on Tuesday -- the country's highest single-day jump. ""I'm anxious as the number of cases keeps going up in Tokyo and I want to stay at home. But I feel conflicted,"" Haru said.  ""Even if the boss told us to close the shop and stay at home, we would have nothing to fall back on. So far, the government has only told people to avoid public gatherings and that has meant fewer customers for us. But the government hasn't specifically said how they would support businesses teetering on the edge."" Bebe Ishikawa runs a Tokyo business supplying fruit to cake shops, hotels and wedding venues. She manages five staff in her office, all of whom come to work. ""If they take the train, I tell them to come in late or leave early to avoid the rush hour or to take a traxi to and from their homes,"" she said.  Ishikawa said she understood that a complete lockdown might be needed eventually to curb the spread of the coronavirus, but warned that many businesses would go bankrupt. ""If we stop delivering our produce then that means our customers can't sell their commodity so each link in the supply chain is affected,"" she said.  False sense of security? So far Japan -- a country of 127 million people -- has more than 2,300 cases of coronavirus, including 57 deaths. A total of 472 people have recovered. However, Japan has only tested about 34,508 people, compared with over 431,700 people tested in South Korea, which has a population of 51 million.  The relatively low recorded infection rate has created a sense of security in Japan, which could be encouraging workers to go into their offices.   ""The (Japanese) government should be stricter like in Europe,"" Kato said. ""The government has too much faith in the public doing the right thing by themselves, but they should send a clearer and more decisive message that tells people that this (coronavirus) situation is really serious.""  Back in Saitama, Tokiyoshi has embraced his teleworking lifestyle and found more time for passion projects. He and his students have overcome the occasional delayed connection, and he hopes this work style can become more accepted in the long term. ""Before, people thought it would be impossible for people to work from home as employees might not be able to focus on their jobs. But now people have realized they can do a lot of things from home,"" he said. "
Disney furloughs employees 'whose jobs aren't necessary at this time',"New York (CNN Business)Facing a complete standstill across its entertainment empire due to the coronavirus crisis, the Walt Disney Company notified its employees that it would furlough employees ""whose jobs aren't necessary at this time"" starting on April 19th.  Disney has been crippled by the coronavirus pandemic. Its theme parks around the world have shuttered, its cruise line is suspended and many of its biggest films of the year have been delayed. Live sporting events, the lifeblood of the Disney-owned ESPN, have also been suspended. Shares of Disney (DIS) have plummeted more than 30% year to date. The impact is hitting Disney's theme park employees especially hard. All of Disney's twelve theme parks have been shuttered since March 15th, after which the company committed to paying salaries through April 18th. In the statement, the company said there was ""no clear indication of when we can restart our businesses,"" and that it was ""forced to make the difficult decision to take the next step and furlough employees."" More than 75% of the company's 223,000 employees work for the Parks and Products division. The furloughed workers would remain employees of the company and keep their health and education benefits, while also being able to access federal and state aid like unemployment benefits. Among those impacted could be the Disney Parks' storied ""Imagineers"" — the designers of the parks, rides and hotels.  Disney's announcement is one of the  signs of the economic destruction rippling through the travel industry, which employs some 319 million workers globally.  Disney executives announced earlier this week that they were taking a pay cut because of the pandemic. The company's CEO Bob Chapek said in an email to employees on Monday that he would take a 50% pay cut while Bob Iger, the company's executive chairman, will forgo all of his salary. ""While I am confident we will get through this challenging period together and emerge even stronger, we must take necessary steps to manage the short and long-term financial impact on our company,"" Chapek wrote. Thursday's furlough announcement specifically relates to the company's US employees, executives, and non-union hourly workers.  -— This story previously misstated the date on which all Disney parks closed. It has been corrected. "
"Tesla overcomes plant shutdowns to again build 100,000 cars in quarter","New York (CNN Business)Tesla built more than 100,000 vehicles in the first quarter, despite shutdowns at its plants in Shanghai and Fremont, California, due to health concerns associated with the coronavirus. The company delivered only about 88,400 of the 102,672 cars it built for customers. The number of completed sales was up 40% from the year earlier. But it was down 21% from the record fourth quarter sales that lifted Tesla to its first annual operating profit. Still, that beat recently lowered Wall Street estimates of 80,000 deliveries in the quarter. It was ""a small victory in a dark environment,"" according to a note from analyst Daniel Ives of Wedbush Securities. Tesla had to temporarily halt production at its new factory in Shanghai in late January due to restrictions put in place in China to combat the coronavirus. It kept its main plant in Fremont, California running even as state officials ordered non-essential businesses in the area to shut. But on March 19 it went ahead and suspended production there as well. Most of the auto industry suffered steep declines in car sales in the first quarter due to shutdowns in much of the United States, Europe and Asia in an effort to battle coronavirus. Forecasts for US and global sales for the entire industry have been slashed in recent weeks. Even with the decline in sales from the company's fourth quarter results, the first quarter performance helped to lift Tesla shares 17% in after-hours trading. Shares of Tesla were among the hottest in the market from June through mid-February, gaining more than 400% in less than nine months as it reached a record close of $917.42 on Feb. 19.  Since then its shares have lost half their value as markets overall declined globally. Even so, they still were up 150% from the June low as of the close on Thursday before the after-hours surge in the price. "
Trump says new recommendations on face masks are coming," (CNN)President Donald Trump said Thursday his administration will soon release nationwide recommendations on wearing face masks after initially telling Americans they weren't necessary to prevent the spread of coronavirus. But a top health adviser on his team strongly cautioned that masks should not lull Americans into a false sense of security that would lead them to abandon social distancing guidelines. Speaking at a White House task force briefing, Trump said the new guidance would stop short of requiring all Americans to wear face coverings.  ""I don't think they'll be mandatory because some people don't want to do that,"" he said, adding that Americans who do want to wear face coverings can ""decide for themselves."" He repeated his assertion that fabric coverings like scarves would be preferential, both because they avoid use of medical-grade masks needed in hospitals and because of their thickness. ""In many ways, a scarf is better. It's thicker,"" he said. Trump did not offer timing on the new recommendations, but people familiar with the matter said the administration was working Thursday to complete the guidance, which would advise Americans to use a face covering when leaving their homes. Vice President Mike Pence said the task force was still weighing recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and would issue recommendations in the next several days. CNN reported on Wednesday that most members of the task force have come to agree that Americans should begin wearing face coverings in public and could issue formal guidance on the matter soon. Some members of the task force -- including Dr. Deborah Birx -- have cautioned in meetings against recommending Americans wear masks because of a fear it could lull them into a false sense of protection and prevent them from socially distancing. But new insights into asymptomatic spread of the virus have led to a reconsideration of the guidance. Speaking at the briefing on Thursday, Birx said White House officials were still debating new recommendations. ""It is not a substitute for the presidential guidelines (on social distancing) that have already gone out,"" she said. ""Don't get a false sense of security that that mask is protecting you exclusively from getting infected."" ""This worries us,"" she added. ""That's why the debate is continuing about the mask."" Among the issues discussed by the task force and the CDC have been how to teach Americans to wear masks and how to prevent a rush on medical-grade equipment, such as N95 respirators, still in short supply for hospitals. There have also been discussions of the cultural shift that recommending masks would represent, since Americans (unlike citizens of some Asian countries) are not accustomed to wearing masks in public. And there has been some consideration of whether or not to call the recommended face coverings ""masks."" Some have suggested referring to them simply as ""face coverings"" or ""courtesy masks"" to distinguish them from the medical masks needed by professionals.    "
"Janice Preschel, 60, who continued to run New Jersey food pantry from hospital bed, dies of coronavirus"," (CNN)In her final days, Janice Preschel continued to run the Helping Hands Food Pantry from her hospital bed in New Jersey.  On Monday, Preschel died of complications from Covid-19 at a Teaneck hospital, Gov. Phil Murphy said. She was 60.  Murphy said on Thursday that 25,590 people across the state have tested positive for disease, and 537 have died. ""Even while she was in the hospital suffering and waiting for her test results and having difficulty breathing, she was still on the phone with me and emailing and sending me instructions on the pantry,"" said Teaneck Deputy Mayor Elie Katz, who wrote a speech that was read at Preschel's funeral service on Wednesday.  Katz said he tapped Preschel to start the food pantry to help families struggling after the 2008 financial crisis.  ""She jumped at the opportunity and, when I told her the salary was zero, she continued to jump at the opportunity,"" said Katz. ""It was in her DNA to serve and to give back to the community."" Katz said Preschel's family has asked those who knew her to spread the word of her plight with the respiratory disease to stress the importance of social distancing. She is survived by two brothers and a sister. Preschel was a former president of the Teaneck Rotary, according to Katz. She was a member of Temple Emeth and a volunteer on the township's social services advisory board.   ""For five years, Janice worked out of my office,"" Katz said in his speech. ""Her desk was three feet away from my desk. She ran the pantry like a well-oiled machine, making sure the volunteers were properly trained and that the donated food was picked up and ready for distribution and, above all, ensuring that each recipient was treated with care, respect, and dignity."" From her hospital bed, Preschel fired off almost daily emails to Katz about the workings of the pantry, he said.   ""She will be remembered as someone who gave herself to giving back to the community,"" said Katz, who is close to Preschel's family. ""She literally would eat, breathe or sleep helping the 100-something families who use the pantry every single week."" Preschel kept active in the community even after a viral infection left her legally blind about five years ago, Katz said.  ""She didn't slow down or stop from running the food pantry,"" he said.  In one of her last emails to Katz, he said Preschel asked him to stop by the pantry to personally thank the volunteers before it temporarily shut down because of the pandemic.    "
Fact check: Trump falsely claims plane and train passengers are being tested for the coronavirus,"Washington (CNN)President Donald Trump falsely claimed Wednesday that airplane and train passengers are being given ""very strong tests"" for the coronavirus both before departure and after arrival. Asked at a White House briefing if he is considering a temporary ban on domestic flights and rail travel, Trump said he was thinking about how to handle flights to and from virus ""hot spots,"" but that it's ""a very tough thing"" to shut down ""entire transportation systems."" He also claimed that there are safeguards already in place. ""They're doing tests on airlines -- very strong tests -- for getting on, getting off. They're doing tests on trains -- getting on, getting off,"" he said.  Facts First: There is no evidence plane and train passengers in the US are being tested for the coronavirus at all, let alone both when they get on and get off. Trump might have meant to refer to screening -- which involves questioning and sometimes temperature checks -- rather than actual testing, but major US airlines and rail company Amtrak are not doing screening, either. Some plane passengers are being subjected to government screening upon landing, but most passengers are not -- and this screening, unlike testing, cannot conclusively determine whether someone has the virus. Under a directive from the Trump administration, passengers returning to the US from Iran, China and most European countries must undergo ""enhanced entry screening"" by the federal government, which can include temperature checks and questions about their current condition and their medical history. There is also a patchwork of state screening at airports. Some states, such as Florida and Texas have been screening passengers arriving from particular places, such as New York, New Jersey and Connecticut -- states for which the federal government has issued an advisory against non-essential travel. Rhode Island has had the National Guard ask questions of people arriving at an airport in Warwick from numerous points of departure.  But screening -- which can require as little as filling out a form -- is not the same as a test to determine if someone has been infected. And most US passengers are not being screened in any way upon disembarking. Other countries are doing more screening of air and rail passengers than the US. Canada announced this week that all passengers would be given a basic health check before boarding and that passengers with symptoms common to the virus would not be allowed to board.  South Korea has been testing all plane passengers arriving from Europe. South Korea has also been screening all passengers boarding flights to the US.  Amtrak, American Airlines and Southwest Airlines had not responded to requests for comment as of 3 p.m. on Thursday. Delta Air Lines and United Airlines referred questions to industry association Airlines for America, which declined to comment. Amtrak says on its website that it has taken extra steps to protect the safety of passengers, such as increasing the frequency of cleaning and selling tickets for only half of trains' capacity. Airlines also say they have acted to keep planes clean and to keep people aboard at greater distances than usual.  "
New Jersey governor calls for 'postmortem' of federal response to coronavirus," (CNN)New Jersey Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy on Thursday called for an assessment of the federal response to the coronavirus once the crisis itself is handled, as states continue to scramble for much-needed medical supplies to combat the spreading virus.CNN's  Clare Foran, Haley Byrd and Manu Raju contributed to this report. When asked by CNN's Wolf Blitzer what the lagging maintenance on some of the federal government's ventilator reserves revealed about national preparedness levels, Murphy noted that the ventilators New Jersey received from the federal government ""had a high rate of functioning.""  ""On the one hand, I'll leave history to the historians in terms of how we got here,"" Murphy said. ""But on the other hand, we've got -- all of us have to do one of the biggest postmortems, when the dust settles on this, in the history of our country."" ""We've got to figure out how the heck we got into this spot and make sure we never get in this spot ever again,"" he added. Murphy's comments echo those of congressional Democrats calling for a commission to investigate what happened in the onset of the coronavirus crisis, with the number of US cases going higher than 236,000 on Thursday and continuing to climb. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced earlier Thursday the creation of a bipartisan House select committee on the coronavirus crisis that will exercise oversight of the federal response to the pandemic and be chaired by Majority Whip Jim Clyburn, a South Carolina Democrat. When asked if she would support a commission to investigate what had unfolded at the start of the crisis, Pelosi said there is ""absolutely"" a need for one, that it's ""something that we should discuss"" and it would have to be bipartisan.  Anything that affects this many Americans, the California Democrat added, needs an after-action review -- ""not to point fingers, but to ensure that it doesn't happen again in the manner in which it happened."" Murphy also said Friday that while New Jerseyans are ""grateful for"" the federal support they've received battling the coronavirus, ""we need a lot more."" He cited his state's efforts to buy personal protective equipment from foreign and domestic sellers and to build hospitals. ""But in all of those channels, in all of those avenues, we can only do so much. Any one state can only do so much,"" Murphy said. ""Again, we need our federal partners with us."" "
Here's what you think of coronavirus if you watch Fox News," (CNN)Every cable network is covering the coronavirus wall-to-wall. And has been doing so for weeks now. THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! In each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! But while the coverage is constant across cable TV news, the message about coronavirus people are getting from the networks isn't the same. At all. Take this question, asked in a recent Pew poll, as to whether the coronavirus originated in nature (it did) or whether it was built in a laboratory (it wasn't). While 66% of MSNBC viewers and 52% of CNN watchers accurately said the coronavirus came from nature, just 37% of Fox News viewers said the same. Or this question about how long it will take for a coronavirus vaccine to be ready. Just 51% of Fox News viewers said it would take a year or more for the vaccine to be available while 78% of MSNBC watchers said it would more than a year for a vaccine. Almost 6 in 10 CNN viewers said the same. (Worth noting: A coronavirus vaccine is, according to medical experts, at least, a year to 18 months away.) The differences between cable network viewers' knowledge of the virus extend to how each network's stalwarts view the coronavirus coverage. Eight in 10 Fox News viewers say the media exaggerated the threat from coronavirus as compared to 54% of CNN viewers and just 35% of MSNBC watchers. Why those numbers matter is because we know -- also from Pew data -- that self-identified conservatives Republicans overwhelmingly turn to Fox News as their preferred source of information. (More than 3 in 4 conservative Republicans and those who lean Republican say that Fox is their main source of information.) The Point: Fox News watchers, who are overwhelmingly Republicans, are reporting a very different -- and less accurate -- view of coronavirus than those who watch CNN and MSNBC. "
Federal judge declines to postpone Wisconsin's April 7 primary but extends absentee voting," (CNN)Wisconsin's primary remains on schedule for Tuesday after a federal judge declined to postpone the contest.CNN's Ariane de Vogue and Adam Levy contributed to this report. Unlike several other states and territories with April primaries, Wisconsin's Democratic Gov. Tony Evers and the Republican-led state legislature have not moved or made major changes to the state's election date amid the coronavirus pandemic.  In a ruling Thursday, US District Judge William Conley did extend the deadline for absentee ballots to be returned from Election Day on April 7 to April 13. He also pushed back the state's deadline to request absentee ballots from Thursday to Friday, and said the state must also count ballots from those who submit ""a written affirmation or other statement"" that they weren't able to get a witness to sign their ballots. But he did not move the primary despite pleas from mayors and concerns from state and local elections officials about a critical shortage of poll workers that has led Evers to say he'll deploy the National Guard to staff polling stations.  The state and national Republican Party, the intervening defendants in the case on behalf of Wisconsin's GOP-led legislature, filed a notice Thursday night that they would appeal Conley's ruling to the US Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals. Wisconsin GOP chairman Andrew Hitt said on Twitter that Conley's ""decision to change the date when absentee ballots can be received without any limitation on the postmark effectively changes the date of the election."" The ruling comes after a flurry of lawsuits seeking changes to Wisconsin's primary that resulted in the national and state Democratic parties siding with advocacy groups looking for looser rules around absentee balloting, while state and national Republicans argued that the election should proceed as planned. Evers last week asked the Republican-led legislature to send every Wisconsin voter an absentee ballot. But Republican lawmakers said there was too little time, and Evers said he viewed himself as restricted by law from moving the primary date. Conley's decision comes the same day the Democratic National Convention, initially scheduled to take place in July in Milwaukee, was postponed until August.  Conley was sharply critical of Evers and the GOP-led legislature in an hours-long hearing Wednesday for failing to move the primary -- but said it was their decision, and not his place to move the election.  ""This is a public health crisis that the state legislature and the governor have refused to accept as severe enough to stop this statewide election,"" Conley said.  The judge offered similar criticism in his decision Thursday.  ""Without doubt, the April 7 election day will create unprecedented burdens not just for aspiring voters, but also for poll workers, clerks, and indeed the state,"" he wrote in the 53-page ruling. ""As much as the court would prefer that the Wisconsin Legislature and Governor consider the public health ahead of any political considerations, that does not appear in the cards. Nor is it appropriate for a federal district court to act as the state's chief health official by taking that step for them."" The Wisconsin Democratic Party had broken with Evers and called for the primary to be postponed. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders also said it should be delayed.  But former Vice President Joe Biden, the front-runner for the Democratic nomination, on Thursday told reporters he thought it could go forward, noting that more than 1.1 million people had requested absentee ballots. ""I think it could be done based on what I'm hearing from the news and what I understand the governor and others are saying. But that's for them to decide,"" Biden said.  "
Trump again tests negative for coronavirus," (CNN)President Donald Trump has tested negative for the novel coronavirus a second time, he announced Thursday. ""This morning, the President was tested again for Covid-19, utilizing a new rapid point-of-care test capability. He is healthy and without symptoms,"" White House physician Sean Conley said in a memo distributed by press secretary Stephanie Grisham just before the daily White House coronatask force briefing. The note, given to reporters moments before the President appeared for Thursday's coronavirus task force briefing, said Trump had the results 15 minutes after taking the test.  Trump said he took the new test, which provides results in 15 minutes, ""really out of curiosity to see how quickly it worked, how fast it worked."" ""I did take a test. It just came out, this is from the White House physician,"" Trump said at the briefing while holding up the memo.  ""I just took it this morning. And I took it, it took me literally a minute to take it and it took me -- I guess it was 14 or 15 minutes (for results). I went to work, I didn't wait for it, but it said it took 14 minutes or something with a conclusion and it said the President tested negative for Covid-19."" News that the President has been tested twice -- he first tested negative for the virus in mid-March after coming into contact with two individuals who had tested positive -- underscores the unique challenge facing the White House as officials grapple with both how to contain the virus outbreak and take steps to avoid spreading it in the executive branch.  The White House last month said it would begin conducting temperature checks on people who come in close contact with Trump and Vice President Mike Pence.  ""Out of an abundance of caution, temperature checks are now being performed on any individuals who are in close contact with the President and vice president,"" Judd Deere, deputy press secretary, said in a statement. Thursday's press conference comes as more than a million cases of the virus have been confirmed worldwide and states across the country continue to hand down strict measures to slow down the spread of the virus. Throughout the outbreak, health care workers, state officials and others have criticized the pace of coronavirus testing in the US as insufficient to enable timely quarantining of patients and to obtain an accurate understanding of the virus' scope.  In response, federal health officials approved a coronavirus test last month that can provide results in less than 15 minutes, using the same technology that powers some rapid flu tests. The new diagnostic test could accelerate testing in the US, allowing for rapid results in doctors' offices. Though shortages of critical equipment used to collect patient specimens, like masks and swabs, could blunt its impact. ""It's a lot easier. I've done them both and the second one is much more pleasant,"" he said of his second test.  Still, earlier this week Trump warned of a ""painful"" and ""tough"" two-week stretch ahead as he extended nationwide distancing measures that -- even if followed closely -- could still mean more than 100,000 and up to 240,000 Americans die from the outbreak. ""I want every American to be prepared for the hard days that lie ahead,"" he said. ""We're going to go through a very tough two weeks."" This story has been updated with additional information Thursday. "
"In just one day, Louisiana reports 2,700 new cases and 37 new deaths from coronavirus"," (CNN)Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards said he will extend the state's stay-at-home order until April 30 as the numbers of coronavirus cases and deaths surge.CNN's Kay Jones contributed to this report.  The stay-at-home order, which allows certain exceptions such as grocery shopping and solitary exercise, was originally set to expire April 13. The announcement Thursday came the same day Louisiana reported more than 2,700 new cases of coronavirus and 37 new deaths.  Since the outbreak started, Louisiana has had more than 9,100 cases and more than 300 deaths from coronavirus. The state's health department said about 95% of the new positive test results came from tests conducted in commercial labs.  ""While extremely upsetting, this increase in COVID-19 cases appears to be less a sign of new exponential growth and more a sign of a logjam from commercial labs,"" Edwards said in a written statement.  ""I have said time and again -- COVID-19 is a statewide problem and testing is a vital step towards understanding the scale of this problem. We believe COVID-19 is spreading in every parish in Louisiana."" The governor implored the public to help stop the spread of coronavirus.  ""The situation remains concerning, but every Louisianan has the power to change the path we are on,"" Edwards said. ""Think of your neighbors, and please stay at home."" "
Thousands of ventilators in maintenance as government struggles to meet needs," (CNN)The federal government had faulty ventilators. Then the coronavirus hit. Thousands of ventilators managed by the federal government were unable to be deployed in the wake of the novel coronavirus pandemic because of a lapse in the government contract to keep the machines maintained, a source familiar with the matter told CNN.  President Donald Trump said Tuesday the federal government was holding on to 10,000 ventilators because of an anticipated surge in the novel coronavirus. But roughly 20% of that reserve -- were out of commission because they needed maintenance. The New York Times first reported the missing ventilators. The news of the inaccessible ventilators comes as states, hospitals and the federal government fight to acquire enough ventilators to treat patients suffering from coronavirus amid the pandemic. And as of this week, the Strategic National Stockpile is almost empty, a source familiar with the situation told CNN Wednesday.  Both California and New York, states reporting higher cases of coronavirus, have reported being sent ventilators that weren't operational. RELATED: Documents show backlog of 160,000 coronavirus tests at just one lab company Late last summer, the US government contract with the company that maintains ventilators and other medical devices within the stockpile lapsed. In September, Agiliti, a Minnesota-based company specializing in these kinds of acute medical devices, was contracted to take over that role but almost immediately after the contract was awarded, the company was told to stand down by the federal government. On January 24, Agiliti was contracted to maintain the ventilators that would eventually be needed, after the first case of the novel coronavirus had been detected in the United States. As the number of coronavirus cases rose in the US, the administration announced there were 16,600 ventilators ready to be deployed, failing to mention that an additional 2,425 of them were out of commission.  In a statement to CNN, a spokesperson from Health and Human Services said that all of the 16,600 ventilators in the stockpile were ""serviced, recertified and operable"" and that the more than 2,000 others ""were in maintenance at that time as part of the normal process,"" adding that ""the SNS, with Agiliti, is committed to making all of these ventilators available for the COVID-19 response by April 30.""  On Wednesday, the government issued a new contract with Agiliti to accelerate the maintenance of the ventilators. The company already has to get them ready to be sent out by the end of the month, and get those ventilators that have already been serviced out the door. This contract will also add a new field service component so that once they are in the field they work and maintain these devices once they are in the hospitals. Supply problems in New York and California The Strategic National Stockpile, the federal government's supply of medical supplies that is managed by the Department of Health and Human Services and distributed to states by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, has seen other problems as well. As of this week, the stockpile has been almost fully exhausted of medical equipment like masks and ventilators, a source familiar with the situation told CNN Wednesday. But leading up to the start of the novel coronavirus pandemic, California and New York reported having been sent ventilators that were inoperational. New York health care provider Northwell Health told CNN it was sent ventilators that were missing parts in an order from the national stockpile. ""We are grateful for the pumps we got from the stockpile but some of them were missing air hoses and stands,"" said Northwell Health spokesman Terence Lynam. Lynam said after the company received the faulty ventilators, it directly ordered the hoses and stands from the manufacturer to get them operational.  Another hospital in New York, NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, also told CNN it received 220 ventilators from the national stockpile last week but the machines needed repair. California also received a shipment of ventilators that weren't operational. ""We're working with Bloom energy and others to convert that cache of 514 ventilators that we had, to refurbish them and to get them fully operational,"" California Gov. Gavin Newsom said last week. Newsom said he worked directly with Bloom Energy to get them operational rather than work with the federal government. ""There was a casual conversation about the 170 ventilators that came from the national stockpile directly to LA County,"" Newsom said later in the week.  ""The conversation wasn't just about those 170, it was about the fact those 170 were not working, and rather than lamenting about it, rather than complaining about it, rather than pointing fingers, rather than generating headlines in order to generate more stress and anxiety, we got a car, and a truck, and we had those 170 brought here to this facility at 8 a.m. this morning.""

Trump invokes Defense Production Act to 'facilitate the supply' of ventilator equipment,"Washington (CNN)The White House announced Thursday that President Donald Trump is invoking the Defense Production Act to clear up supply-chain issues encountered in the manufacturing of ventilators and to ensure the production of additional N95 face masks.This story has been updated with additional reporting about Trump's directives. Thursday's orders come amid increased fears of ventilator shortages and personal protective equipment around the country. The use of ventilators among critical coronavirus patients and the demand for protective equipment, such as the N95 respirator, has skyrocketed since the coronavirus pandemic hit the US.  The first order, a White House statement said, will help domestic manufacturers ""secure the supplies they need to build ventilators needed to defeat the virus.""  The President also said the move ""will save lives by removing obstacles in the supply chain that threaten the rapid production of ventilators.""  The order, which came in the form of a presidential memorandum, directs the supply of materials to make ventilators to six companies: General Electric Co., Hill-Rom Holdings Inc., Medtronic Public Limited Co., ResMed Inc., Royal Philips N.V. and Vyaire Medical Inc. It also directs acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf and Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar to ""use any and all authority available under the Act to facilitate the supply of materials"" to these companies.  A second order invokes the Defense Production Act to authorize Azar and Pete Gaynor, the administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, to ""use any and all authority available under the Act to acquire"" N95 respirators from 3M.  Speaking about the decision to invoke the act against 3M, Trump told reporters, ""Hopefully they'll be able to do what they are supposed to do."" A spokesperson for General Electric said the company welcomes ""efforts by the administration to address supply chain constraints and help the industry in its mission to produce as many ventilators as possible for clinicians on the front lines treating COVID-19 patients.""   After signing an executive order authorizing the use of the Defense Production Act for coronavirus-related federal procurement, Trump initially stopped short of using it against specific companies.  Even after he signed an executive order activating the use of the act for coronavirus supplies, Trump had argued that businesses were voluntarily pitching in and didn't need to be threatened by the invocation of the act.  ""Frankly, they don't need someone to walk over there with a hammer and say do it,"" he said at the time.  But last week, Trump invoked the Defense Production Act to require General Motors to produce more ventilators.  The President has faced pressure to use the act to procure medical equipment and protective equipment for dealing with the coronavirus in the US.  The Defense Production Act, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, is ""the primary source of presidential authorities to expedite and expand the supply of resources from the US industrial base to support military, energy, space and homeland security programs.""

FBI warns video calls are getting hijacked. It's called Zoombombing," (CNN)As video conference app Zoom surges in popularity due to increased usage amid the coronavirus pandemic, federal officials are now warning of a new potential privacy and security concern called ""Zoombombing.""CNN's Melissa Alonso contributed to this report. The term refers to a form of cyber harassment reported by some app users, who have reported that some of their calls have been hijacked by unidentified individuals and trolls who spew hateful language or share graphic images.  ""Zoombombing"" has become so prevalent that this week the FBI issued a news release to warn people of the threat. The FBI received ""multiple reports"" of video conference calls being interrupted by ""pornographic and/or hate images and threatening language,"" the agency said in its release. A spokesperson for Zoom told CNN in an email on Thursday that the company is aware of the FBI's recent press release and ""appreciates all efforts to raise awareness around how to best prevent these kinds of attacks."" ""We are deeply upset to hear about the incidents involving this type of attack and we strongly condemn such behavior,"" the spokesperson said in an email statement.  The company said it began ""actively educating users on how they can protect their meetings and help prevent incidents of harassment"" on March 20. ""We are listening to our community of users to help us evolve our approach,"" the spokesperson said.  Incidents across the US The FBI Boston Division cited two recent ""Zoombombing"" incidents at schools in Massachusetts.  In late March, the FBI said in an unidentified person or persons dialed into a high school teacher's online class and yelled a profanity, as well as the teacher's home address.   In a separate instance, also in a Massachusetts teacher's virtual classroom, an individual who joined the conference call was seen on the video camera displaying swastika tattoos, the FBI said. Similar ""Zoombombing"" threats have been reported across the country.  In Orange County, Florida, one man entered a virtual class and exposed himself, CNN affiliate WKMG reported. At the University of Southern California, in Los Angeles, administrators sent an email to the university community last week addressing online class breaches. ""We are sorry to report we learned today that some of our online Zoom classes were disrupted by people who used racist and vile language that interrupted lectures and learning,"" USC President Carol Folt and Provost Charles Zukoski wrote in an email, obtained by CNN. ""We are taking immediate action to protect our classes from what is called Zoombombing -- which, unfortunately, is taking place in organizations around the country."" These instances of ""Zoombombing"" come as Zoom faces scrutiny over its privacy protections, which have been flagged by users, security researchers and US authorities. Mitigating threats Eric Yuan, Zoom's CEO and founder, published a blog post on Wednesday to address people's recent security concerns.  In it, he cited the company's plan for the next 90 days to dedicate ""the resources needed to better identify, address and fix issues proactively.""  These initiatives, he wrote, include ""enacting a feature freeze"" and ""conducting a comprehensive review with third-party experts and representative users to understand and ensure the security of all of our new consumer use cases,"" according to the post. Yuan also addressed ""zoombombing"" by referring concerned users to a March 20 blog post that outlines ""the protective features that can help prevent this."" ""Keep Zooming responsibly,"" the blog post reads, after listing tips to help ""keep unwanted guests out."" Federal officials urged those using video teleconferencing apps to exercise ""due diligence and caution"" in their cybersecurity efforts to help mitigate these threats. Both the FBI and Zoom shared some steps to help secure video conference calls and protect people from potential hackers or trolls.  They recommend users: make their meetings private (Zoom has options to require a password, as well as a waiting room function to control who's allowed in the call); avoid sharing the meeting link on public online forums; and limit screensharing to just the call's host.

"Zoom CEO apologizes for having ""fallen short"" on privacy and security","San Francisco (CNN Business)The founder and CEO of Zoom has apologized to the video conferencing app's millions of users after coming under fire for a host of privacy issues at a time when it has emerged as a vital social and professional lifeline for many. ""We recognize that we have fallen short of the community's -- and our own -- privacy and security expectations,"" Eric Yuan said in a blog post on Wednesday. ""For that, I am deeply sorry.""  Zoom will stop adding new features for the next 90 days and instead focus solely on addressing privacy issues, Yuan said. The company will also release a transparency report, similar to the ones periodically shared by tech giants such as Facebook (FB), Google (GOOGL) and Twitter (TWTR), which details requests for data or content from government authorities.  The coronavirus outbreak has seen millions of people ordered to stay in their homes flock to Zoom, which has garnered praise for its features and usability. Yuan said Zoom crossed 200 million daily meeting participants in the month of March. People have used the video conference app for everything from brunches and birthday parties to religious events and even a UK cabinet meeting. But the spike in popularity has led the company to quickly find itself dealing with many of the issues that have plagued larger online platforms, particularly around privacy.  This week alone, Zoom has come under scrutiny from the New York Attorney General and the FBI, faced questions from security experts about the level of encryption on its platform, and been hit with two class action lawsuits over a feature (which it has since deactivated) that shared some user data with Facebook.  The controversy has hit Zoom's previously meteoric stock price, which had nearly doubled since the end of January but closed 11% lower on Thursday and has fallen around 24% this week.  Yuan said Zoom was created mainly for ""large institutions with full IT support"" such as universities, government agencies and financial services companies.  ""We did not design the product with the foresight that, in a matter of weeks, every person in the world would suddenly be working, studying, and socializing from home,"" he added. ""We now have a much broader set of users who are utilizing our product in a myriad of unexpected ways, presenting us with challenges we did not anticipate.""  Zoom also apologized for its misleading claim that it offers ""end-to-end encryption for all meetings,"" which would mean that all content on its platform is visible only to participants. Some security experts expressed doubt about Zoom's ability to provide that level of encryption, saying the type of encryption it provides would allow the company to access some information through its servers.  Oded Gal, Zoom's chief product officer, said in a blog post on Wednesday that Zoom does not decrypt any information if all participants of a meeting are on its app and if the meeting is not being recorded. Full encryption is not possible if any of the participants are dialed in from a phone or another external device.  ""While we never intended to deceive any of our customers, we recognize that there is a discrepancy between the commonly accepted definition of end-to-end encryption and how we were using it,"" Gal said.

Navy expected to remove commander of aircraft carrier hit by coronavirus for being suspected of leaking memo,"Washington (CNN)The commander of a US aircraft carrier that has been hit by a major outbreak of coronavirus has been relieved of command for showing ""poor judgment"" days after writing a memo warning Navy leadership that decisive action was needed to save the lives of the ship's crew, acting Secretary of the Navy Thomas Modly announced on Thursday.   ""Today at my direction the commanding officer of the USS Theodore Roosevelt, Captain Brett Crozier, was relieved of command by carrier strike group commander Rear Admiral Stewart Baker,"" Modly said during a Pentagon press briefing.  Modly told reporters that Crozier was removed for showing ""extremely poor judgment"" and creating a ""firestorm"" by too widely disseminating the memo detailing his concerns, copying some 20 to 30 people. He said Crozier was not removed because of any evidence suggesting he leaked the memo to the press, but rather for allowing ""the complexity of his challenge with the Covid breakout on the ship to overwhelm his ability to act professionally when acting professionally was what was needed the most at the time."" ""I have no information nor am I trying to suggest that he leaked the information. It was published in the San Francisco Chronicle. It all came as a big surprise to all of us that it was in the paper, and that's the first time I had seen it,"" he added.  The information in question was contained in a memo written by Crozier earlier this week to the Navy's Pacific Fleet. Modly called Crozier's note ""a blast-out email to everyone he knows."" ""We are not at war. Sailors do not need to die. If we do not act now, we are failing to properly take care of our most trusted asset — our Sailors,"" it read, three US defense officials confirmed to CNN. Modly said Crozier was relieved because he went outside the chain of command and sent his memo over an unsecured system, adding to the chances it could be leaked.  ""He sent it out pretty broadly, and in sending it out broadly he did not take care to ensure that it couldn't be leaked, and that's part of his responsibility, in my opinion,"" Modly said.  ""I have received absolutely no pressure. I have had no communication with the White House about this,"" he added. ""I did, when I was arriving closer to this determination yesterday, I called Secretary Esper and told him that this was the direction I was heading and he told me he would support my decision whatever that might be."" Top Democrats on the House Armed Services Committee slammed the move in a statement Thursday.  ""While Captain Crozier clearly went outside the chain of command, his dismissal at this critical moment -- as the Sailors aboard the U.S.S. Theodore Roosevelt are confronted with the COVID-19 pandemic -- is a destabilizing move that will likely put our service members at greater risk and jeopardize our fleet's readiness,"" they said.  ""The COVID pandemic presents a set of new challenges and there is much we still do not know. Captain Crozier was justifiably concerned about the health and safety of his crew, but he did not handle the immense pressure appropriately. However, relieving him of his command is an overreaction,"" the lawmakers added.  Number of positive cases continues to increase News of Crozier's removal comes after a US defense official told CNN earlier Thursday that 114 sailors from the USS Theodore Roosevelt have tested positive for the virus, representing more than 10% of all cases across the US military. The outbreak on the ship is escalating rapidly. Last week the Pentagon confirmed three sailors on the Roosevelt had tested positive, and that number had risen to 25 two days later. It rose to at least 70 on Tuesday and more than 100 on Thursday. On Monday, a US defense official told CNN that a second US aircraft carrier, the USS Ronald Reagan, is facing a ""handful"" of positive cases. In his memo, Crozier implored Navy leaders to take immediate steps to address the situation.  ""Decisive action is required. Removing the majority of personnel from a deployed US nuclear aircraft carrier and isolating them for two weeks may seem like an extraordinary measure,"" his memo said.  ""This is a necessary risk. It will enable the carrier and air wing to get back underway as quickly as possible while ensuring the health and safety of our Sailors. Keeping over 4,000 young men and women on board the TR is an unnecessary risk and breaks faith with those Sailors entrusted to our care,"" Crozier added.  Modly said Wednesday that if it turned out the letter was leaked it ""would violate the principles of good order and discipline if -- if -- if he were responsible for that. But, I don't know that. The fact that he wrote the letter of -- to his chain of command to express his concerns would absolutely not result in any type of retaliation. This is what we want our commanding officers to be able to do."" On Thursday, Modly asserted that the decision to remove Crozier from his post ""is not one about retribution, it's about confidence. It is not an indictment of character, but rather of judgment."" ""While I do take issue with the validity of some of the points in Captain Crozier's letter, he was absolutely correct in raising them,"" he said. ""It was the way in which he did it ... that was unacceptable to me,"" the acting Navy secretary added. Sailors quarantined  CNN previously reported that some of the sailors from the USS Theodore Roosevelt will be quarantined in hotel rooms in Guam as the number of coronavirus cases aboard the carrier continues to increase. On Wednesday Modly said 1,273 of the ship's roughly 4,800 crew members have been tested for the virus so far and the Navy was still awaiting the results of some of those tests.  He said about 1,000 sailors have been evacuated from the ship and moved ashore to Guam where the ship is currently in port. ""We already have nearly 1,000 personnel off the ship right now. And in the next couple of days we expect to have 2,700 of them off the ship,"" Modly told reporters at the Pentagon. Some sailors will have to remain on the ship. The Chief of Naval Operations, Adm. Mike Gilday, said that the ship could not be evacuated in its entirety due to the need to continue to perform essential tasks such as the operation of the aircraft carrier's nuclear reactor.  He said that about 1,000 sailors would have to remain on the ship to perform, about 500 more than was proposed by Crozier in his recent memo. ""This ship has weapons on it, it has munitions on it, it has expensive aircraft, it has a nuclear power plant. It requires a certain amount of people on that ship to maintain the safety and security of the ship,"" Modly said. "
FDA changes blood donation guidelines amid urgent need for blood during coronavirus pandemic," (CNN)The US Food and Drug Administration issued new blood donation eligibility guidance Thursday as US blood supplies decrease amid the coronavirus pandemic. The changes are to be implemented immediately and are expected to remain in place after the pandemic ends. Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.CNN's Amanda Watts contributed to this report. The FDA has guidelines in place to reduce the risk of transmitting HIV through blood, and is shortening its recommended blood donation deferral period for some groups: For male donors who have had sex with another man, female donors who would have been deferred for having sex with a man who had sex with another man and for those who recently got tattoos or piercings, the recommended blood donation deferral period changes from 12 months to three months. US Surgeon General Jerome Adams said in a media briefing following the release of the new guidelines that HIV-positive people are still barred from giving blood. But those taking taking a pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, to prevent HIV infection can still donate if they're not using the medication to treat HIV infection, said Dr. Peter Marks, the FDA's director of the Center for Biologics and Evaluation Research, who participated in the briefing. Whether they need to discontinue the use of the medication and for how long is up to the donation center, he said. ""The individual donor centers will have policies that may require that someone stop those medicines for a period of time, but that, that is something that is generally left to the discretion of the donor centers,"" Marks said. The FDA is also making changes to its blood donation guidelines for people who have traveled to countries where malaria is endemic -- the recommended deferral period changes from 12 months to 3 months.  And for people who spent time in European countries or military bases where there is a risk of transmission of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease or variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, the agency is eliminating recommended deferrals. Increasing blood donations The FDA said there is an ""urgent"" need for blood, blood products and plasma, and waived the standard public comment period in issuing the new guidance, but said blood donation centers are not required to implement these changes. ""We expect that the updated guidance and alternative procedures will help increase the number of donations moving forward, while helping to ensure adequate protections for donor health and maintaining a safe blood supply for patients,"" according to a statement Marks put out before the media briefing. ""People who donate blood are part of our critical infrastructure industries. More donations are needed at this time and we hope people will continue to take the time to donate blood,"" he said.  Marks later emphasized in the briefing that coronavirus is a respiratory illness and, like the flu, is not generally transmitted by blood. ""The concern is not about passing the virus by transfusion. The concern would be about other donors in the donor center."" American Red Cross safety practices ""Social distancing does not mean social disengagement,""  Adams said Thursday, addressing the issue in the briefing. ""Maintaining our nation's blood supply is always critical but especially now as donations drastically drop.""   The American Red Cross is assuring donors that it's safe to give blood at local centers during the pandemic and that it's just as crucial to community health as going to the grocery store or pharmacy. ""We should all practice social distancing, but it's important to know that blood drives are not considered ""mass gatherings"" because they are controlled events with trained staff and appropriate safety measures to protect donors and recipients,"" the agency said on its website. The agency said each Red Cross donation center has taken steps to insure donor safety and infection control practices are in place, including temperature checks on staff and donors, hand sanitizing before and during the blood donation process, social distancing between donors and regular disinfection of surfaces and equipment.

Why the coronavirus crisis will expand America's racial wealth gap,"New York City (CNN Business)The novel coronavirus has already dealt an unprecedented economic blow to a large portion of American workers, with a record 9.9 million people filing for unemployment over a two-week span from March 16 to March 29. The full scope of the damage remains unclear, but researchers and labor force leaders say the financial pain caused by the crisis probably won't be evenly distributed along racial lines. The economic fallout from business closings and job losses is expected to have a greater impact on black and Latino employees, who make up a disproportionate percentage of occupational sectors experiencing the income disruption amid the pandemic. ""When white America catches a cold, black America catches pneumonia,"" Steven Brown, a research associate at the Urban Institute domestic policy research organization, told CNN Business. Government data shows the outbreak is more concentrated in major US metropolitan areas like New York City, New Orleans and the nation's southeast where greater percentages of black and Latino Americans live. In New York City, the virus is disproportionately affecting lower-income neighborhoods in Queens, Harlem and the Bronx, which have denser populations of immigrants of color, African Americans and Hispanics. Blacks, Latinos, and Native Americans also tend to have more underlying health conditions, like asthma, than whites, which USA Today says makes them more likely to suffer from serious health effects from the coronavirus. Those health effects could mean more hospital visits and more medical debt at a time when many are losing their jobs and health benefits. Chuck Collins, director of the Institute for Policy Studies' ""Inequality and the Common Good"" program, says America's already enormous racial wealth disparity is likely to grow ""unless we pursue a very different set of interventions and stimulus,"" than those put in place in response to the Great Recession of 2008. The average black household had a net worth of $140,000 in 2016, while the average white household's net worth that same year was $901,000, according to a Survey of Consumer Finances study cited by the Federal Reserve. Most of that white wealth was concentrated among the top 1% of American earners. Economists from the Corporation for Enterprise Development and Institute for Policy Studies predicted that black families wouldn't earn the same wealth held by white families in 2016 until the year 2241, when white families would have even greater wealth. Latinos would match the earnings of whites in 2016 by 2097, researchers concluded. Collins said the $2 trillion authorized by Congress is a good start to getting Americans back on their feet, but much more needs to be done. ""Nobody's going to talk about [how we're] paying for this anytime soon. When and if they do, there's going to be a huge fight over who's going to carry the load here,"" he said. ""If we did income support right so people didn't have to go to work ... then people aren't going into debt. That could help close the racial wealth divide."" Brown agrees that the current crisis is likely to widen America's racial wealth disparity. The 2008 financial crisis actually hurt white Americans more economically than blacks and Latinos, contrary to popular belief, and ironically narrowed the racial wealth gap, at least temporarily. It's true that the unemployment rate for black Americans peaked at 16.8% in 2010, more than twice that of white Americans. But Brown points out that white Americans owned a disproportionate number of the homes foreclosed on by banks and a greater share of the retirement investments that were decimated when the stock market crashed nearly 12 years ago. ""Black families also lost wealth, but they had less to lose,"" Brown told CNN Business. Collins agrees that white families lost more in the stock market in 2008, but says they were able to recover much of those losses in the following two years. ""White wealth rebounded very quickly,"" he said. ""It was more diversified and wasn't just in real estate."" The Great Recession did significant damage to Americans families' assets, but Brown said so far the coronavirus is having a greater affect on Americans' ability to pay their day-to-day bills. ""The thing to keep an eye on is debt,"" Brown said. ""Black and brown families are more likely to have no savings or net worth at all. ... If they lost their job, going check-to-check even two weeks can mean some credit card bills or utilities don't get paid. ""It's going to be a lot harder for people to dig out once things get stable again,"" he added. "
Yang says Asian Americans being attacked over coronavirus is 'a heartbreaking phenomenon',"Washington (CNN)Former Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang said Thursday it is a ""heartbreaking phenomenon"" that Asian Americans have been the target of a growing number of racist and xenophobic attacks related to the coronavirus. CNN's Maegan Vazquez contributed to this report.  Yang, a CNN political commentator, told CNN's Lisa Ling on a live episode of ""Go There,"" CNN's show on Facebook Watch, ""I've gotten the same messages you have, Lisa, about friends and Asian Americans who are being either spat on or attacked or assaulted around the country."" ""And it's just a heartbreaking phenomenon where, just like you, I mean, we're reacting to this the same way any other American does, which is with anxiety about the future and concern about what's going to happen with our families, our neighbors,"" Yang continued. ""But then it's compounded by the fact that you know there's this massive increase in hostility and animosity towards Chinese Americans, Asian Americans, because so many Americans associate this virus with China."" President Donald Trump said last week that the spread of the coronavirus in the US is not the fault of Asian Americans, and that it is important to protect the Asian American community in the US. Trump's tweet came less than a week after the President defended his use of the terms ""China virus"" and ""Chinese virus"" to describe the novel coronavirus, which originated in Wuhan, China.  After consulting with medical experts and receiving guidance from the World Health Organization, CNN has determined that that name is both inaccurate and considered stigmatizing. Yang, who ended his presidential campaign in February, said he didn't see any ""positive value to calling it the China virus, except to incite hostility."" He said that ""Chinese virus is definitely part of the lexicon at this point, and you know, I've heard of schoolchildren getting called the Chinese virus and being bullied mercilessly."" The businessman said it was important to distinguish between the Chinese government and the Chinese people when talking about the coronavirus.  He said the Chinese government ""bears a lot of responsibility for the fact that it covered up the seriousness of the crisis early on"" and added that China did not share accurate data with the rest of the world that could have helped other countries, including the US, prepare for the pandemic.  ""The seeds of this crisis certainly can be laid at the feet of the Chinese government, but then there's the Chinese people, who suffered some of the same things that we're suffering,"" Yang said. He added that Asian Americans were ""a world away while some of these decisions were being made by Chinese government officials."" "
Banks were the problem in 2008. They can help this time,"New York (CNN Business)In 2008, when the global economy was last in tatters, big banks were largely to blame. Their bad bets on subprime mortgages and other loans were what pushed the world into the Great Recession. Since then, banks have become much more financially responsible, thanks to a combination of more stringent rules and regulations and smarter business practices.  As a result, financial firms may be the ones to help keep the economy afloat now that it's tanking a dozen years later due to the Covid-19 pandemic.  Loans to small businesses in particular will be key, and experts say banks will need to augment the efforts that Washington has already put into place through the Small Business Administration's new Paycheck Protection Program. ""Unlike 2008, banks are not part of the problem. And they will be a big part of the solution,"" said Dan Genter, CEO of Genter Capital Management, an investment firm that owns shares of JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C) and Truist (TFC) -- the new bank formed from the merger of BB&T and SunTrust. Banks need to act quickly to prop up small business ""The SBA can't handle all the loan volume that will be needed. The only way to meet the demand is for the banks to lend more,"" Genter added. Several large banks have already started.    (GS)Goldman Sach (GS)s unveiled a $300 million aid package Thursday, which includes $250 million in emergency loans for small businesses. Citigroup CEO Michael Corbat said in a CNBC interview Wednesday its small business bankers are fielding questions around the clock, including weekends, from merchant customers. And Citi is doing most of this digitally so small business owners need not leave their homes. ""We don't want to have people having to come out, so we're making sure that we've got the digital interface set up so that people can apply online,"" Corbat said. ""We can turn this money and get it into small business hands as quickly as we can. CNN Business reached out to several other large banks to find out what they are doing to help. Truist told CNN Business that it has a $2 million commitment set aside to support small businesses affected by the pandemic. ""For our small business clients, we're here to help. We're offering numerous relief options, including deferred loan payments and fee waivers to help support short-term operating capital needs, as well as a special loan program without bank fees or closing costs,"" a Truist spokesman said. Flexibility is key for banks working with small businesses TD Bank (TD) said it is doing what it can for its small business customers,  too. A spokeswoman said that it is offering refunds of monthly maintenance and overdraft fees, waiving several monthly service fees and providing ""flexibility"" on paying back existing loans due to any hardship as a result of the coronavirus. It also plans to make Paycheck Protection Program loans as well. ""TD Bank is committed to helping our business customers during this trying time,"" the spokeswoman said, adding that it will ""provide loans for businesses to cover payroll, employee benefits, mortgage interest, utilities, rent and interest on other debts. PNC (PNC) said that it is working with small business customers that are struggling and will offer some ""the ability to postpone payments for a period of time"" and ""a range of modification options with no late fee."" It also plans to take part in the SBA's PPP. A spokesman for US Bancorp (USB) said the company is reducing the rate on certain short-term small business loans by as much as 2%, waiving fees on businesses receiving digital payments via Zelle and cutting rates on lines of credit. ""We recognize many small business owners have been hard hit by COVID-19,"" the US Bancorp spokesman said.  And a Wells Fargo (WFC) spokesman told CNN Business that ""we are committed to supporting our small business customers in a variety of ways, including payment relief for up to 90 days, fee waivers, payment deferrals, increases to lines of credit...and other expanded assistance for deposits."" Wells Fargo will make loans through the SBA PPP as well.  ""Our customers are experiencing challenges during the COVID-19 crisis and we want to help during these unprecedented times,"" the Wells Fargo spokesman said.  More help is needed -- now But some think banks and other financial firms must do even more to help keep small businesses afloat. ""Financials can provide loans but they may need more to do than that. The situation is dire and severe,"" said Guy Goldstein, CEO of Next Insurance, an online broker that caters to small businesses. Next Insurance did a survey of 1,000 small businesses two weeks ago and found that only 34% of them felt they were prepared for the current crisis while 41% have already begun to cut expenses. That's one reason why Goldstein said his firm has cut monthly premiums for small business customers and is giving back some money to companies who already paid for annual coverage. ""The impact from the coronavirus will have a lasting effect on the small business economy,"" said NFIB chief economist Bill Dunkelberg in a report Thursday.  ""The small business labor situation has been altered. The severity and duration of the coronavirus outbreak and the mobility of regulations imposed will determine owners' ability to remain operational,"" he added. "
FEMA still pushing back on taking a leading role in coronavirus supply chain," (CNN)Despite states' continued calls for more federal involvement, the Federal Emergency Management Agency is still pushing back against playing a more active role in leading the supply chain, according to House Democrats.Priscilla Alvarez contributed to this story.  Officials from FEMA and the Department of Health and Human Services briefed members of the House Oversight Committee this week on the coronavirus response. In the briefing, the Democrats said, FEMA acknowledged that private businesses producing personal protective equipment for medical workers was ""not moving fast enough for any of us,"" and that trying to get enough masks to match the need of states and hospitals from private businesses was like ""chasing rabbits in an open field.""  But the federal officials resisted the idea that FEMA should have a greater role in the supply chain, as many states are urging, saying that the agency ""attempting to replace private-sector supply chains does not work."" Federal officials also told House lawmakers that there's a lag in obtaining new ventilators from the private sector, and acknowledged they knew ""as early as mid-January"" that the US wouldn't have enough N95 respirator masks if a coronavirus outbreak were to occur, according to Democrats on the oversight panel. The committee has begun probing the Trump administration's response to the novel coronavirus, with new documents showing that FEMA has provided states with only a fraction of the supplies they've requested.  The Democrats said the federal government was ""not able to provide specific timelines about when additional equipment and supplies would be procured by the federal government and made available to states."" The committee said that FEMA officials acknowledged the demand for ventilators ""outstrips the capacity"" of the Strategic National Stockpile and the Pentagon, with about 9,500 ventilators remaining in the stockpile.  ""By the week of April 13, the Supply Chain Task Force will have acquired only about 3,200 more,"" the committee said. ""FEMA reported that most of the 100,000 ventilators promised by President Trump will not be available until late June at the earliest."" The new information from the oversight panel comes as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced Thursday she would create a select committee to investigate the administration's response to the coronavirus outbreak. The committee -- led by Democratic Whip James Clyburn of South Carolina -- will focus on how the administration spends trillions in stimulus funds.  ""The committee will be empowered to examine all aspects of the federal response to the coronavirus to ensure that taxpayer dollars are being wisely and efficiently spent to save lives, deliver relief and benefit our economy,"" Pelosi said in a letter to her colleagues Thursday.  It's not clear how the new committee will interact with the Oversight Committee, which has broad jurisdiction to investigate across the federal government.  House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy questioned the need for a new panel, saying it would be ""redundant"" when other committees can already conduct oversight and criticizing the selection of Clyburn to lead it. ""Congressman Clyburn is the one who thought that this crisis is an opportune time to restructure government. That's not what we should be doing,"" the California Republican said.  McCarthy also cautioned that getting the select committee up and running would require a House vote, which isn't likely to happen anytime soon, with the House not expected to have any votes before April 20. The Oversight Committee, led by Democratic Rep. Carolyn Maloney of New York, collected data from FEMA on Monday on what states have received from the federal government's Strategic National Stockpile, a federal collection of medical supplies for an emergency that wasn't intended to fill all of the needs the states now have. The committee obtained data from five states and Washington, DC, showing just how little of the states' requests for critical medical supplies are being filled through the stockpile. The panel's information tracks with what states across the country have been saying for several weeks, as most are seeing just a fraction of their requests being filled by the stockpile, which was not intended to supply the entire country. Washington, DC, and the five states -- Maryland, Virginia, Delaware, Pennsylvania and West Virginia — collectively reported receiving less than 10% of the N95 respirators, surgical masks, surgical gowns and gloves they sought. The region received a little more than 25% of the face shields it requested and more than 40% of requested face and surgical masks, according to data provided on Monday. Trump confirmed on Wednesday that the stockpile is mostly depleted as supplies have gone out to the states. He said they weren't planning on refilling it so they could instead directly send the supplies the federal government receives to states and hospitals. But states have said they are still competing with the federal government to obtain supplies like N95 respirator masks, expressing frustration at the supply chain issues with the federal government.  ""We're sending it directly to hospitals,"" Trump said. ""We don't want it to come to the stockpile because then we have to take it after it arrives and bring it to various states and hospitals."" On March 3, HHS told a Senate committee that the Food and Drug Administration was working to stay ahead of medical supply shortages. But when GOP Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah asked Robert Kadlec, HHS assistant secretary for preparedness and response, what would be necessary in a ""full-blown pandemic"" -- at that point, coronavirus had not become one -- Kadlec noted a major shortfall was looming. ""If it were to be a severe event, we'd need 3.5 billion in N95 respirators,"" Kadlec said. ""We have about 35 million."" "
What happened when a president ignored the science on an epidemic,"Robyn Curnow is a CNN anchor and host of CNN International's ""CNN Newsroom with Robyn Curnow."" The opinions expressed here are her own. Read more opinion at CNN. (CNN)The sickness is hidden at first; nobody knows if they have it, if they are a carrier. There is confusion too. Many questions about how the infection spreads. People don't curb risky behavior. Scientists warn about exponential growth in the number of cases. People start to get sick. They cough, gasp for breath, become too weak to get out of bed. Often alone. So much death. Families, clinics, hospitals, entire communities are overwhelmed. It is a virus; new and not understood, contagious and indiscriminate. Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook   For a time, the President does not listen to the virologists, or the doctors who are treating the growing numbers of the afflicted. He does not track epidemiologists' warnings or pay attention to their mapped-out projections. Neither does he implement his own government's plan of action. He refuses to acknowledge there is a problem. He waits, obfuscates, delays. He politicizes a national health crisis. He confuses his own people with half-baked ideas and random conspiracy theories. He blames others for bringing the virus to his people.   When the situation deteriorates to the point that he is forced eventually to do something, his messages are still mixed and his response is piecemeal. The damage is done. The virus penetrates deep into the heartland, spread by inaction, misinformation and a dire lack of leadership at crucial moments when the infection could have been slowed. I'm not talking about America today. All of this happened over two decades ago, in my home country of South Africa, where for years President Thabo Mbeki refused to deal with the HIV/AIDS epidemic rampaging across the nation. By the time he did, South Africans had paid a terrible price. And while the differences between HIV/AIDS and Covid-19 are myriad, some stark lessons from the past have crystallized for me.   Over the past few weeks, I have watched and listened as President Donald Trump got off to a stumbling start with echoes of Mbeki's mistakes. For those of us who have witnessed both Mbeki's long denial of the AIDS epidemic and Trump's response to the coronavirus emergency, there are alarming similarities between these men's behavior at the early stages of a public health crisis. The most simple and heartbreaking connection between both is that their delayed response impacted the lives of those they swore an oath to protect. In South Africa, a doctoral thesis by a student at the Harvard School of Public Health estimated more than 330,000 South Africans unnecessarily died between 2000-2005 because of the Mbeki government's obstruction of treatment.    Trump may finally be getting to grips with the gravity of the situation, thus dropping his talk of filling churches for Easter, extending federal social distancing measures to April 30 and acknowledging that more than 100,000 Americans could die from Covid-19 -- perhaps more than 2 million if ""we did nothing.""  But disconnects remain, with Trump saying that if there are fewer than 100 000 deaths -- almost twice as many as American soldiers killed in Vietnam -- ""we all together have done a very good job."" In addition, the President has pitted state governors against each other, equated the virus with the common flu, denied there are shortages in critical protective equipment and refused to take early warning models seriously -- leaving states, hospitals and medical staff unprotected and unprepared. Since this novel coronavirus has the ability to quickly spread largely undetected in the absence of robust testing in the United States, each day of indecision and misdirection has cost the country dearly in terms of preparation and allocation of badly needed resources.   Both Mbeki and Trump put off taking quick, bold decisions because they were distracted by false information. The US President likes to take his cue from Fox News which, for weeks, downplayed the threat and suggested that the clamoring calls for more action and preparation was just liberal hysteria targeting 'his' economy and chances of reelection.    In South Africa, Mbeki -- who took office as the widely respected successor to Nelson Mandela -- spent hours on the internet, often late into the night, finding articles and connecting with those who dismissed the links between HIV and AIDS. He downplayed the virus -- like Trump in the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic -- saying it was not a potent medical threat.    Mbeki suggested that the science behind HIV/AIDS and antiretroviral drugs was a conspiracy by large pharmaceutical companies and Western (white) countries to perpetuate insulting stereotypes about African sexuality and masculinity. His own political party could not, or would not, disagree with him. His doubts became the foundation of a compromised health system. Even after anti-retrovirals became available his administration actively opposed and delayed the deployment of the drugs. The government actually went as far as refusing to roll out medication known to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV. It took a Constitutional Court ruling to force the government to give a single dose of nevirapine to mothers in labor and their infants within 72 hours of birth. An estimated 35,000 babies were born with HIV as a direct consequence of the Mbeki government's failure to manage and distribute available medical resources.       Trump too has suggested others (the Chinese) are to blame for the virus.      In South Africa, Mbeki and his ill-prepared health minister advocated a regime of eating vegetables such as beetroot and African wild potatoes to protect against infection. The underlying premise was correct -- a good diet with plenty of vitamins could boost immune systems. However, the mixed messages soon were misinterpreted and confused South Africans who thought some local vegetables could protect against AIDS.   Certainly Trump isn't refusing to allow Americans the benefit of new treatments in the way that Mbeki did 20 years ago. But he seems to have ignored expert warnings about the threat of a global pandemic when he took office in 2017. And his over the top optimism about a yet unproven drug  generated some confusion when he used anecdotal evidence to declare that variants of the anti-malarial drug chloroquine might be a treatment for coronavirus. After he mentioned it at a briefing, a Phoenix couple tried to self-medicate with a non- pharmaceutical version of it -- an additive used to clean fish tanks. The man died and the woman had to be admitted to critical care.  In Nigeria, health officials said three people had overdosed on the drug after Trump's comments. (The FDA has since granted emergency authorization to use the drug. This drug may yet prove effective but in the meantime public health officials are left to clean up this confusion urging people not to hoard the drug so that those who need it for treatment of things like lupus can get their regular prescription filled.   Mbeki's administration eventually corrected course, but not before hundreds of thousands of lives were lost. Even today, the more than 7 million South Africans living with HIV must still confront the stigma born in those early few years of the epidemic.  Coronavirus and HIV/AIDS are, of course, different diseases. But Mbeki demonstrated to the world the tragic cost if leaders fumble their initial responses to a pandemic. Leadership is about taking tough decisions, gaming out strategies and putting lives above politics. History has shown there is a hideous price to be paid for ignoring medical science. "
"In Pennsylvania you can buy liquor and wine again online, but only if you're lucky"," (CNN)Two days after Pennsylvania re-opened its state-owned liquor stores online, it's already struggling to keep up with the ""overwhelming demand."" As a result, Fine Wine & Good Spirits -- which sells all of the state's liquor -- is now regulating when people can order their liquor.  ""Due to overwhelming demand, the online store is not available at this time,"" the Fine Wine & Good Spirits website reads. ""Please try again tomorrow or in the coming days. We apologize for the inconvenience.""   The Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board said in a statement that access to the website will be randomized ""to avoid overwhelming the site with high traffic, prevent order abuse and prolong access throughout the day, so that order availability isn't exhausted in seconds or minutes each day."" All Pennsylvania state liquor stores and licensee service centers closed on March 17 to help slow the spread of coronavirus. The liquor control board handles all beverage alcohol distribution in Pennsylvania, operating nearly 600 wine and spirits stores statewide. There are at least 6,063 reported cases of coronavirus in Pennsylvania, with 79 reported deaths, according to CNN's latest tally of US cases. On March 17, sales were up 513.6% over the same day in 2019, Elizabeth Brassell, Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board's communications director, told CNN. Sales in March, through March 17, were up 57.9% over the same period the prior year. State residents can still buy beer and wine at grocery and convenience stores, and from restaurants, bars and taverns to-go, according to Brassell.  Those who are lucky enough to gain access to order online can only buy up to six bottles per transaction from a limited inventory of around 1,000 wines and spirits, according to a statement from The Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board.  The orders can only be shipped to a home or non-store addresses, and only one order per address will be fulfilled per day. ""We believe that re-opening FineWineAndGoodSpirits.com in a controlled manner will allow us to provide access to consumers while also protecting our employees and consumers from unnecessary risk,"" Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board Chairman Tim Holden said in a statement. The board said it is not considering reopening brick and mortar stores right now, but will monitor the situation and consult with health officials moving forward.  "
Tune in to Dr. Fauci,"Michael D'Antonio is the author of the book ""Never Enough: Donald Trump and the Pursuit of Success"" and co-author with Peter Eisner of ""The Shadow President: The Truth About Mike Pence."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author. View more opinion articles on CNN. (CNN)Want to feel better in this moment of crisis? Stop binge-watching the shows. Put down the ice cream. (They'll be there later.) Tune in to Tony Fauci when he appears on TV or better yet, listen to him chat with Dr. Sanjay Gupta on his CNN podcast. Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook   When you do, you'll hear the leader we need as others fail us. Dr. Fauci is a man with a scientific mind, a compassionate heart, and a Jesuitical commitment to helping others. He refuses to blame even the President, who was tragically slow to heed his counsel. And he won't stop fighting until we are safe.   If you don't know him by now, Anthony Fauci is the silver-haired, bespectacled physician-scientist who stands in the background at White House briefings on the coronavirus pandemic and steps up to speak when the questions get technical and, more importantly, demand precise, authoritative answers. Head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases since 1984, he has taken responsibility for fights against everything from HIV/AIDS to now Covid-19, and has never sought to hold the spotlight or grab credit.   For weeks it has been Fauci who has countered the President's hype about possible treatments and vaccines with realism. An anti-malarial drug Trump feels good about will need ""the kind of trial where you get the good information,"" Fauci said. A vaccine would be great, but won't arrive sooner than 12 to 18 months. As he offers sober facts like these to counter President Trump's loose and emotional talk, Fauci performs some nearly miraculous feats. First, he manages to contradict the President without provoking his ire. Second, he gives the country reasonable hope. Lastly, he demonstrates what compassionate authority and grace under fire really look like.   You may be surprised to learn, as I was, that the nimble-minded, indefatigable Fauci is 79 years old. Daily exercise -- 3.5 miles of running or power-walking -- has blessed him with a level of fitness that puts many people decades younger to shame.  A lifetime of engagement with high-level medical science seems to have kept his mind young in the same way.   However, it is Fauci's strong character that we sense when listening to him speak with care for both the facts and the human beings who now hang on his words.    ""I'm very much of a people person but also I'm very analytical and very scientific,"" Fauci explained to Gupta on the CNN podcast. He recalled attending a Jesuit high school and college and noted that ""the one theme always underlying our interactions was service to others."" Put it together -- ""science, I like people, service to others"" -- and ""that's medicine.""   Listen to Fauci talk with Gupta one-on-one, physician-to-physician, and you hear how much he cares about the people and science he is supposed to serve.  Free of the tension that the President brings to the White House briefings, the podcast conversation offers Fauci unfiltered. You can feel the affection and concern he expresses for every person he mentions and for the country he serves. You can also hear a mind on fire as he describes the puzzle of Covid-19's effects on those who contract it.   As Fauci says on the podcast, many people suffer only mild illness before recovering fully but some endure a shocking turn for the worse.  Speaking of ""the dynamics of the virus against our attempt to mitigate it"" he observes that a patient can be doing well then ""bingo, they're on a respirator. They're on ecmo (heart/lung treatment.) Then they're dead.""   Fauci's tone is not callous but rather it echoes with the clinical fascination a general might feel for a persistent battlefield foe. ""There's something there, Sanjay, that we're missing,"" he adds, ""from the pathogenesis standpoint.""   The tenacity that Fauci has displayed as a scientist was evident early in his life when, as a kid surrounded by Brooklyn Dodgers fanatics, he remained devoted to the Yankees. Though bookish, he worked construction during school vacations, and though slightly built, he was a fierce competitor on the basketball court.    These experiences helped him develop the skills that let him navigate around difficulty throughout his profession. He became fast friends with activists who at first vilified him during the AIDS crisis. Now he's forging a productive relationship with a President who, famously dismissive of experts and advisors, considers gut instinct to be his compass.   Somehow Fauci seems to have won President Trump's confidence even as he has corrected him in real time. In this way the doctor has served both the President and the country while maintaining his own credibility.  Neither a toady nor an attention-seeker, he has put himself in the position to tell everyone the truth, even when it's hard to hear.  Fauci has been the target of criticism from some on the far right who falsely accuse him of being politically opposed to Trump.   On the podcast Fauci agrees that in the federal response, ""there probably were some missed opportunities."" Considering how America has lagged behind South Korea and others, to say otherwise would be foolish.  But Fauci says he is more concerned about the future right now than the past. When it's over, he hopes the country will make itself better prepared for the next public health threat. In the meantime, he'll lead, with a modesty and seriousness that is refreshing in this age of Trump.  ""I'm doing everything I can,"" he says, ""and I'm not alone.""   "
The Point: How the fight for the Senate is slowly moving toward Democrats," (CNN)With the country -- and the world -- focused full-time on the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, you may have missed this: The fight for the Senate continues to move slowly but surely in Democrats' direction. THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! In each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! That's according to two leading political handicapping sites: the Cook Political Report and Larry Sabato's Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia. On Thursday, the Crystal Ball moved the ratings of the a) Arizona Senate race from ""toss up"" to ""leans Democratic"" and b) Maine's Senate race from ""leans Republican"" to ""toss up."" (They also changed the rating of the Georgia Senate race from ""leans Republican"" to ""likely Republican."") ""The battle for the Senate is getting more competitive, with Democrats pushing the overall map more into 'toss-up' territory,"" writes Crystal Ball managing editor Kyle Kondik of the ratings changes. Those changes come soon after the Cook Report's Senate editor Jessica Taylor wrote this about the fight for the Senate majority: ""The chances of Democrats taking back the Senate are rising, and is now close to 50-50 odds."" ""The full political implications of this ongoing [coronavirus] crisis aren't fully realized yet, and no one truly knows how the pandemic will play out in any form, or even how long it will last or how big a hit the economy will take, and whether it can rebound by November. But conversations with nearly a dozen Republican strategists and pollsters this week revealed alarm about how Trump — who is in many ways so uniquely unsuited to manage such a wide response from the government actors he distrusts — is not only risking his own reelection prospects but those of many Republican senators."" To that end, the Cook Report made ratings changes in Iowa and Texas suggesting both GOP incumbents are more imperiled than in past months. (Cook also moved the Mississippi Senate seat, held by Cindy Hyde-Smith, out of the danger zone.) Let's take a step back and look at the overall math -- and map. To win the majority in November, Democrats need to make a net three-seat gain if their party wins the White House and four if President Donald Trump is reelected.  The Cook Report currently rates eight GOP held seats as endangered -- either as ""toss ups"" (Arizona, Colorado, Maine and North Carolina) or ""lean Republican"" (Georgia's Kelly Loeffler, Iowa, Kansas and Montana.)  Only two Democratic seats are seen as vulnerable: Alabama's Doug Jones (""lean Republican"") and Michigan's Gary Peters (""lean Democratic""). The Crystal Ball ratings are a bit more bullish for Democrats with two seats currently held by Republicans (Arizona and Colorado) ranked as ""leans Democratic,"" Maine and North Carolina seen a pure ""toss-ups"" and Montana, Iowa and Loeffler's Georgia seat rated as ""leans Republicans."" Jones' Alabama seat is seen as ""leans Republicans"" while Peters' in Michigan is rated as ""leans Democratic."" The key here isn't any specific seat as much as it is about the broader landscape. For Democrats to have a realistic chance of winning the three (or four) seats they need to retake the Senate majority in November, they need to expand the map of competitive Republican races while simultaneously limiting any unseen vulnerabilities in their own seats. That's what's happened in recent weeks. Montana Gov. Steve Bullock's stunning, last-minute reversal on his long-stated opposition to running for the Senate turned that contest from no race into, potentially, the race of the 2020 Senate cycle. And Democrats now look to be very well-positioned in both Colorado and Arizona, with Maine and North Carolina following close behind. On the other hand, aside from Jones in Alabama, which, candidly, looks like a near-certain loss, there are very few Democratic seats in any sort of danger. Now, keep this all in perspective: Assuming Jones loses, Senate Democrats need to net either four seats (if Joe Biden wins the White House) or five (if Trump is reelected). Which is no sure thing -- given that the number of truly vulnerable Republican seats is somewhere between seven and eight.   But there's also no question that Democrats' chances of winning the Senate are higher today than they were six months ago, and much higher than at the start of 2019. "
Amazon says it's taking coronavirus seriously. Workers say the company is endangering their health," (CNN Business)Amid mounting criticism of its pandemic response, Amazon on Thursday said it is rapidly expanding temperature checks for its employees and that it has nearly completed its hiring spree of 100,000 additional workers at its distribution centers. The announcements illustrate the pressure Amazon (AMZN) is under as it grapples with a tidal wave of delays for sold-out items and complaints from employees about workplace safety during the pandemic. Despite Amazon's expressions of support for its workforce, some Amazon employees and applicants told CNN Business that the company's messaging doesn't always match what they have seen inside the company's warehouses, and that they remain concerned about crowded hiring events and training sessions, limited access to disinfectant wipes and the company's overall ability to follow through on its commitments.  Confirmed cases of the coronavirus are known to have hit more than a dozen Amazon facilities in recent weeks, prompting calls for multiple fulfillment centers to be closed for deep cleaning. Employees of at least three sites have staged walkouts this week protesting Amazon's decision to keep the centers open for business. Workers at Amazon's LGB3 facility in Eastvale, Calif., have created a petition to close the building, saying the demands of their job make it impossible to comply with the company's social distancing guidelines. One of the changes Amazon mentioned in its blog post Thursday is daily temperature checks for employees in the United States and Europe, which the company said it began on Sunday. More than 100,000 employees per day are now receiving temperature checks, the blog post said.  As part of a response to several questions from CNN Business, an Amazon spokesperson declined to provide a list of facilities where temperature checks have begun. The company previously told CNN Business that it is piloting the temperature checks in ""in select sites in New York City and Seattle,"" including its Staten Island facility, JFK8. But two Amazon employees who spoke with CNN Business portrayed an effort at JFK8 that is less comprehensive than the company is admitting.  Employees of JFK8 were notified on Sunday via a message in the employee ""A to Z"" app that beginning that day, the company would ""begin conducting a daily temperature check for everyone entering the building for the first time that day at the start of their shift,"" according to a screenshot viewed by CNN Business.  But the two employees at JFK8 who spoke with CNN Business about the checks said the company did not check their temperatures, or the temperatures of other workers, when they were entering the facility at certain times this week. One of the employees said they started experiencing symptoms during a shift this week and that a manager instructed them to go home. On the way out of the facility, security took their temperature, and found a fever above the 100.4F threshold recommended by the Centers for Disease Control. When asked why some workers did not have their temperature checked upon arriving, an Amazon spokesperson could not explain it, but claimed that all employees at the facility have been receiving the temperature screenings every day since Sunday. The mixed messaging continued on Thursday, when employees at JFK8 saw a new message in the employee app, also viewed by CNN Business, that suggested daily temperature checks had not yet begun as previously claimed.  ""In the next few days, we will begin conducting a daily temperature check,"" the message read. ""You'll be notified when this is starting at your site."" Amazon told CNN Business that the message was delivered to JFK8 employees as part of a wider communication to company associates. Amazon declined to provide an updated count of the number of coronavirus cases at its Staten Island facility, where employees have claimed that as many as 10 workers have been diagnosed but only three cases have been disclosed. In Thursday's blog post, Amazon also described disinfectant wipes and hand sanitizer as ""standard"" across the company, but several employees told CNN Business that supplies were extremely limited at the facilities where they work. At the DTW1 facility in Romulus, Michigan, Amazon issues just three disinfecting wipes per shift -— one at the beginning of each shift and one after each of two breaks, Mario Crippen, an employee at the facility who led one of the strikes this week, said. ""One person walks around handing it out so you got to wait until they come around to you to get a disinfectant wipe,"" he said.  Hand sanitizer is limited, too, according to Crippen.  ""They have one person outside the break room squirting hand sanitizer on people's hands because we're running so low,"" he said.  Two Amazon employees at SDF4, a facility in Kentucky, told CNN Business that hand sanitizer bottles at the site are empty, disinfecting wipes are being rationed and Clorox wipes are unavailable. ""We Amazon employees work hard every day, the least [the company] could do is be honest about the condition of things inside the belly of this beast,"" one of the SDF4 employees told CNN Business. Amazon acknowledged to CNN Business the possibility of cleaning supply shortages at some sites, but said it has added 450,000 containers of disinfecting wipes and tens of thousands of hand sanitizer containers to its facilities. In Thursday's blog post, Amazon also said that face masks it has ordered for workers are finally becoming available and will be distributed in the coming days, and that the company is conducting daily audits of the new safety measures it has implemented since the outbreak began. Those measures include more aggressive cleaning, policies designed to keep employees separated, and requirements that delivery drivers wipe down their vehicles with disinfectants at the beginning and end of every shift.  Amazon added that it has hired 80,000 of its planned surge of 100,000 workers, reflecting how quickly the company has had to adjust to spikes in customer demand. But the need to hire so many people so quickly has created some potentially dangerous situations.  One job applicant told CNN Business she arrived for her interview with Amazon only to discover what she estimated as 30 to 40 applicants crammed into a single waiting room, with many people having to stand because all the chairs were taken. The company had provided a solitary bottle of hand sanitizer for the room, and some people were coughing and sneezing. The person, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of jeopardizing her employment prospects, said she took one look at the situation and fled. She has not rescheduled her interview. ""I'm never applying for Amazon again,"" she told CNN Business. According to Crippen, new hires are being packed closely together in training rooms at the facility where he works. Last week, he said, the facility hired 86 new workers who needed on-boarding. ""Some of the people that do the new-hire training are afraid to do it,"" Crippen said. ""There are so many people at one given time and there's no way to social distance in one room."" Amazon said that its recruitment centers follow social distancing guidelines, with markers laid out on floors to separate job candidates. Dave Clark, Amazon's senior vice president of worldwide operations, said in Thursday's blog post that the company has made more than 150 changes to its processes to enhance worker safety. ""With over 1,000 sites around the world, and so many measures and precautions rapidly rolled out over the past several weeks, there may be instances where we don't get it perfect,"" Clark wrote, ""but I can assure you that's just what they'll be — exceptions.""

Analysis: Coronavirus has already permanently changed our economy and the way we live," (CNN)The US government effectively shut down the US economy in its effort to keep Americans at home and, hopefully, slow the spread of Covid-19. A version of this story appeared in CNN's What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. The direct result is that a stupefying number of American workers -- nearly 10 million in two weeks -- filed for first-time unemployment benefits.  But while it is now agonizingly clear the pandemic outbreak is nowhere near finished, the economic crater being dug to deal with the health crisis seems likely to last even longer and is already much worse than anyone predicted. That means it will be much harder for the government to put back together the economy it took apart in order to save lives. At the same time, it's already possible to see how this outbreak will permanently change our lives. I talked to David Wessel, who is director of the Hutchins Center on Fiscal & Monetary Policy at the Brookings Institution, about exactly how unprecedented all of this is and how we all might go about putting back together a decimated economy. Read more from Brookings on this here. Our conversation, edited slightly for flow, follows: Totally unprecedented ""kill switch"" ZBW: It seems safe to say there is no precedent for what's taking place since, rather than fighting a war or dealing with failures in the economic system, the US and other countries intentionally hit the ""kill switch"" on economic activity. What parallels do you see between this and previous global events?  DW: It's hard to find a historical precedent. The closest is the 1918 influenza epidemic.   This is like a major war in some respects, but it's really unusual for the government to hit the ""kill switch"" and tell everyone to stay home, not go to work or to shop, and to close so many businesses. In wartime, we try to mobilize resources to increase production; this time, we are doing the opposite.   There's an interesting new paper by some San Francisco Fed economists that compares the long-run economic effects of major deadly pandemics to deadly wars: They note that wars destroy lots of physical capital; pandemics don't.  And think how different this is from the days following 9/11 when President George W. Bush told us all the patriotic duty was to go shopping; now it's the opposite. Moving quickly is key ZBW: In the Great Recession, the economy dug out for a long period after the housing crisis. But in this case the government has gone to extraordinary lengths almost before the worst of the pandemic has hit. Will that have any effect on how and whether the extraordinary measures by the Fed and the government work?  DW: Answer: Yes!  Both the Fed and Congress moved forcefully and quickly. At least some folks in power learned a few lessons from the Great Recession.  The fiscal and monetary responses are aimed both at cushioning the blows to people hit hard by Covid-19 AND at keeping businesses and other employers on life support so we can more quickly restart the economy when the virus passes.  I have no doubt the recession will be shorter and shallower and the recovery stronger than they would have been without these measures.  But we're still going to have a deep recession, and a lot of people will get hurt economically.  And unless all the virus disappears with unanticipated speed, Congress probably will need to do more.  Hoping for a quick bounce back ZBW: What do you make of the idea that since the economy appeared to be on solid footing and is now dealing with a ""force majeure rather than a fundamental problem, that it will bounce back?  DW: Answer: Hope so.  It's true that the economy was in good shape before the virus hit, and that's a plus. We're a lot better off than Europe in that respect.   We don't yet know, though, how we will re-start the economy -- presumably in stages -- or whether the virus will return or how much damage we've done to the economy's capacity to produce goods and services.   If a lot of firms go under, if consumers are frightened, if banks are reluctant to lend, if travel and tourism is depressed for a long time, then the recovery could be painfully weak. This will change the way we live ZBW: What's your best guess as to what the US economy look like on the other side of this? Will this lead to permanent changes in the way Americans interact, work and trade.  DW: Answer: Good question, hard to answer.  We'll surely -- I hope -- be investing more in public health after this. I suspect that the expansion of tele-medicine will last beyond the Covid-19 crisis.   More people may work from home with implications for transit systems and office space.  We may find that virtual conferences are a reasonably good substitute for in-person meetings and travel less often.  And perhaps this'll show us the pros (and cons) of online education.   One thing seems likely: interest rates will be very low for a long time. That's bad for savers, good for borrowers.   Will people save money for retirement and save differently, given the declines in their 401(k) plans?   We'll surely be re-examining the wisdom of importing so much from abroad, and will probably be sure we are producing more health care gear here at home.  I think a really big question is whether we emerge from this with more sense of common purpose -- of helping each other -- or with even more xenophobia and hostility to immigrants and foreigners than we had before.  We all thought life would never be the same after 9/11, and in some respects, it isn't. We all had to get used to TSA screening at the airports. But New York City didn't wither, as some predicted. And until Covid-19 hit, I didn't sense any widespread anxiety about terrorism (other than the cyber kind) that changed the way we live. Worse by far than the Great Recession ZBW: Around 10 million Americans have filed a first unemployment claim in the past two weeks. How should we all view these staggering figures in the weeks ahead? DW: Answer: Staggering is the right word.   We've never seen anything like this before. More people have filed for unemployment claims in the last two weeks than in the first six months of the Great Recession. It's an indication of just how abruptly we shut down the economy and how widespread the pain.   The good news, if there is any, is that 6.6 million people managed to file claims despite all the reports of crashing computer systems and long waits on phone lines at state unemployment offices.  And it underscores the importance of the the expansions of the unemployment insurance safety net that Congress just approved -- more workers eligible and $600/week extra in every check. This will help millions of people get through this awful period, and will reduce the depth of the Covid-19 recession. "
"British Airways furloughs 30,000 workers","London (CNN Business)British Airways will furlough 30,000 of its employees with pay, as the coronavirus pandemic halts global travel, forcing airlines to ground planes and slash costs. The United Kingdom's flagship carrier, owned by International Airlines Group (ICAGY), said in a statement Thursday that it is implementing a ""furlough scheme"" to minimize the financial impact of the coronavirus on staff. After talks with unions, British Airways agreed to provide workers with 80% of their regular pay, with no cap on earnings, according to the major UK union, Unite. The first £2,500 ($3,095) will be paid by the government, with BA making up the shortfall, Unite said in a statement. There will be no unpaid temporary layoffs and the measures will be in place until the end of May. This is ""as good a deal as possible for our members,"" said Oliver Richardson, Unite's national officer for aviation. ""The deal protects the jobs of BA staff and, as far as possible, also protects their pay,"" he said in a statement. British Airways, which on Monday suspended flights from London's Gatwick airport, is the latest major European carrier to announce sweeping operational changes. On Monday, UK budget carrier EasyJet (ESYJY) grounded its entire fleet, furloughing 4,000 cabin crew. Europe's largest low-cost carrier Ryanair (RYAAY) will ground more than 90% of its aircraft over the coming weeks, while Scotland-based Loganair plans to approach the government for financial aid.  Airlines around the world have been brought to their knees as the pandemic worsens, particularly in Europe and North America, with flight bans and nationwide lockdowns threatening to shut down aviation altogether. Many carriers have slashed or suspended their short-term flight schedules, placed workers on unpaid leave and paused hiring. Several industry CEOs have stopped taking salaries.  Bailouts ahead While US airlines will receive tens of billions of dollars in support as part of the country's $2 trillion stimulus package, governments in Europe have not promised bailouts to their carriers. The UK government has said that airlines, like all companies, can make use of measures to help businesses hit by the coronavirus, including capital-raising programs and tax relief. ""We are continuing to work closely with the sector and are willing to consider the situation of individual firms, so long as all other government schemes have been explored and all commercial options exhausted, including raising capital from existing investors,"" a government spokesperson said. Virgin Atlantic on Thursday declined to comment on media reports that the airline is seeking financial assistance from the UK government. The company said that Richard Branson, its billionaire owner, is plowing $250 million into Virgin Group companies to protect jobs.  Lufthansa, which owns national carriers in Germany, Switzerland, Austria and Belgium, said in a statement Thursday that it is ""in close contact"" with the federal governments of its home markets to secure its liquidity. A spokesperson for Airbus (EADSF) told CNN Business that the plane maker is ""strongly advocating government support for all airlines."" ""[There is] no more 'normal' for aviation,"" analysts at CAPA Centre for Aviation, said in a report Thursday. ""The revenue reduction faced by airlines this year as a result of COVID-19 far exceeds the impact from previous crises. It has the dimensions of a world war,"" they noted. The International Air Transport Association expects the crisis to cut industry revenues globally by $252 billion this year compared to 2019, with airlines burning through $61 billion in cash in the second quarter. -- Eoin McSweeney and Chris Liakos contributed to this report.

Fact check: Georgia governor says we only just learned people without symptoms could spread coronavirus. Experts have been saying that for months,"Atlanta (CNN)Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp said on Wednesday that new information on the spread of coronavirus influenced his decision to issue a stay-at-home order. In particular, Kemp pointed to what he said was the recent discovery that the virus can be spread by people who are not exhibiting symptoms.  ""What we've been telling people from directives from the CDC for weeks now that if you start feeling bad stay home, those individuals could have been infecting people before they ever felt bad. But we didn't know that until the last 24 hours,"" said Kemp, a Republican. Facts First: It's not true that people didn't know ""until the last 24 hours"" that individuals without symptoms could be infecting people with coronavirus. Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, said in mid-February that asymptomatic transmission of coronavirus was possible. Furthermore, studies from as early as January showed cases of coronavirus spreading amongst people with no symptoms.   Kemp's press secretary said the governor was referring to an update that the CDC made to its guidance on March 30 that indicated there's a higher risk of people without symptoms passing on the virus. The updated guidance changed the period of exposure risk for individuals from ""onset of symptoms"" to ""48 hours before symptom onset.""   As more has been learned about the virus, several experts told CNN last month that it's become clear that transmission by people who are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic is responsible for more transmission than previously thought.   Though it wasn't the first time he acknowledged it, Redfield confirmed that suspicion in a March 30 interview with NPR affiliate WABE, in which he said ""as many as 25%"" of individuals who are infected with coronavirus may remain asymptomatic. ""One of the [pieces of] information that we have pretty much confirmed now is that a significant number of individuals that are infected actually remain asymptomatic,"" Redfield said.   In a February 13 interview with CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta, Redfield said asymptomatic transmission of coronavirus was possible and concerning, based on information from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.   ""There's been good communication with our colleagues to confirm asymptomatic infection, to confirm asymptomatic transmission, to be able to get a better handle on the clinical spectrum of illness in China,"" Redfield said. ""What we don't know though is how much of the asymptomatic cases are driving transmission.""   As of January 30, the CDC noted in its guidance for managing patients with coronavirus that ""Clinical presentation among reported cases of 2019-nCoV infection varies in severity from asymptomatic infection or mild illness to severe or fatal illness.""    The potential for asymptomatic transmission is something that Dr. Anthony Fauci, the country's top infectious disease expert, first raised two months ago.   In late January, Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and a member of President Donald Trump's coronavirus task force, told CNN, ""There's no doubt after reading this paper that asymptomatic transmission is occurring."" The paper Fauci referenced is a study published on January 30 in the New England Journal of Medicine.    Public health experts have since said the January study was flawed, because a patient who was said to be asymptomatic actually had mild symptoms. Yet the latest update to the CDC site also cites several studies from February and March documenting coronavirus in asymptomatic patients. The CDC guidance clarifies that ""although transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic persons has been reported, risk of transmission is thought to be greatest when patients are symptomatic.""    Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, echoed the CDC's caution in a March 14 briefing with other members of the coronavirus taskforce where she acknowledged that asymptomatic patients could be spreading the disease.   ""Until you really understand how many people are asymptomatic and asymptomatically passing the virus on, we think it's better for the entire American public to know that the risk of serious illness may be low,"" Birx said, ""but they could be potentially spreading the virus to others.""

Tekashi 6ix9ine's lawyer is 'hopeful' rapper will be released from prison because of coronavirus risk," (CNN)Tekashi 6ix9ine was released from federal prison Thursday after his attorney said the rapper's asthma made him vulnerable to the novel coronavirus. CNN's Rebekah Riess contributed to this report. The rapper, whose real name is Daniel Hernandez, will serve the rest of his sentence at home, his defense attorney Lance Lazzaro told CNN.  His release comes about four months before Hernandez would have completed his 2-year sentence. He was sentenced late last year on charges related to gang activity in New York, but received a reduced sentence after cooperating with federal investigators and informing on his former gang associates. The rapper is not the only inmate to be released amid the coronavirus pandemic.  In recent weeks, there's been a national push for the release of at-risk inmates as the number of coronavirus cases grows inside correctional facilities. US Attorney General William Barr directed leaders of the federal prison system late last month to increase home confinement for some inmates.  Judge says he would have sentenced home confinement Lazzaro filed a letter in federal court on March 22 asking that his client be released to avoid the risk of contracting Covid-19. Lazzaro reiterated in another letter on March 31 that Hernandez has ""severe asthma and was recently hospitalized for bronchitis,"" making him vulnerable to the coronavirus.  New York District Judge Paul Engelmayer denied the request, stating he did not have the authority to grant the request. Hernandez, the judge said, should instead seek compassionate release from the Bureau of Prisons.   But the judge also indicated the sentence would have been different if he had known of the coming pandemic and the threat it posed to people with asthma, like Hernandez. ""Had the court known that sentencing Mr. Hernandez to serve the final four months of his term in a federal prison would have exposed him to a heightened health risk,"" Engelmayer wrote in the order, ""the Court would have directed that these four months be served instead in home confinement.""  But the BOP also denied the request because Hernandez is not in its custody. He is technically in the care of the US Marshals Service in a private prison.  So Lazzaro went back to the judge, arguing Engelmayer did, in fact, have the authority to order Hernandez's release -- a claim backed by the US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, which prosecuted Hernandez's case.  US Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman wrote in a letter to Engelmayer that the court would have the authority to reduce the sentence if it found ""extraordinary and compelling reasons"" related to the defendant's health, citing federal law. Additionally, Berman wrote the government ""does not oppose"" a compassionate release for Hernandez. "
Covid-19 may inspire a new generation of doctors and scientists,"Julian Zelizer, a CNN political analyst, is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University and author of the forthcoming book, ""Burning Down the House: Newt Gingrich, the Fall of a Speaker, and the Rise of the New Republican Party."" Follow him on Twitter: @julianzelizer. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN. (CNN)The devastating coronavirus has already claimed the lives of over 50,000 people across the world -- and shows little sign of letting up anytime soon. But if there is one glimmer of hope in this global nightmare, it's that it may inspire a generation of Americans to consider pursuing careers in the medical and scientific fields, just as other crises have inspired past generations in particular ways.  Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook   In the current battle to stop the spread of Covid-19 and move us toward some sort of recovery, the men and women working in health care and medical research are our troops. They are the modern-day version of the greatest generation from World War II -- the tens of thousands of people who sacrificed their lives to combat fascism in the 1940s.   This time around, the heroes operate in laboratories and hospital rooms. And they are doing everything possible to treat those who have the virus, develop a vaccine to combat future outbreaks and employ the best statistical techniques to track how the pandemic is unfolding. And, regardless of the national politics, these health care workers keep their heads down and do the work that is so badly needed.    We have gone through other periods when crises of this magnitude have motivated younger generations of Americans to pursue professions that meet the needs of those moments. After the Great Depression, young men and women entered into public service at the federal or state level, seeing government as a force for good in American life. Wilbur Cohen, for example, started his career as a staffer on Franklin D. Roosevelt's Committee on Economic Security, which helped design Social Security -- and spent much of the remainder of his career working in the Social Security apparatus.    And a young Texan named Lyndon Johnson came to work for a congressman in 1931, then led the Texas National Youth Administration in 1935. Johnson was responsible for administering money for jobs, education and more to young Texans. These experiences strengthened his resolve to run for a House seat in 1937 and to spend several decades in Congress before becoming president, during which he would seek to go beyond FDR's New Deal with the Great Society.    People like Cohen and Johnson understood that public policy -- and federal legislation -- helped save the nation from the ravages of economic hardship during the Great Depression. More specifically, programs like Social Security, the Public Works Administration, the Civil Works Administration and others offered economic security -- and even jobs -- when unemployment soared. As a result of these programs, between 1950 and 1975, one out of every four jobs in the non-farm economy was in government.   Following  the Vietnam War and Watergate in the 1970s, when investigative journalists helped to uncover political falsehoods that had justified a terrible war and exposed the corruption of power that had taken place in Richard Nixon's White House, more Americans decided to devote their lives to the newsroom, determined to never miss those kinds of stories ever again. ""Applications to journalism school are at an all-time high,"" Time magazine noted in a cover story during the summer of 1974, ""and many of the youngsters say that they want to be investigative reporters.""   Tim O'Brien, a Pulitzer Prize winning reporter who worked for Bloomberg and the New York Times, was 12 when he learned about the Watergate hearings in summer camp. After seeing ""All the President's Men"" in 1976, where Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman glorified the work that Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein had done for the Washington Post, he was inspired to pursue a career as a journalist -- remarking: ""'Wow, these are the guys that set everything in motion.'""   Now, following the death toll from the coronavirus, we see why medicine, science and public health are so critical to functioning of our society -- a reality that will continue to be true as the threat of future pandemics remains.   When this the coronavirus has been beaten -- and it will be one day -- we will need the government to provide financial support for individuals who want to enter these fields, as we saw after World War II when politicians in both parties poured millions of dollars into the coffers of universities and research institutions that were engaged in work relevant to the Cold War through the National Defense Education Act.   We will need high schools to develop new STEM programs to maximize interest in these fields, and we will need universities to dedicate even greater resources toward nurturing those who seek to pursue careers in the sciences. There will have to be discussions about whether there are needs to streamline the graduate training process and to make any necessary changes to the curriculum. It will also be essential to provide better solutions to crushing student debt.    Lastly, we will need parents to tell their children the stories that they witnessed and experienced, as our nation sheltered in place for weeks on end.   National crises are horrendous to live through. They scar generations and wreak havoc on our lives. But they also expose elements of society that we have all but ignored -- and shine a spotlight on professionals who perhaps were not receiving the credit they deserved.   We will never forget the sacrifices that our health care workers and scientists are making right now.  And hopefully, as a result, their ranks will be strengthened, so that we are better prepared to deal with this sort of threat if and when it emerges again. "
"Cats may get coronavirus, but experts say it's nothing to worry about"," (CNN)A newly-hatched study out of China, so raw that it's not yet been peer-reviewed, has some disturbing news for cat lovers.Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team. Our furry feline friends appear to be susceptible to catching Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2. Even worse, the cats in the study were able to infect each other, although they showed no signs of illness.  Ferrets were also able to ""catch"" the virus, although it didn't appear to harm them. Dogs, on the other hand, were not susceptible, according to the study. The virus showed up in the feces of five dogs, but no infectious virus was found. Pigs, chickens and ducks were also not very hospitable places for the virus.  But there's no need for cat or ferret lovers to panic, experts say. There's no evidence their pets could get very sick or die from the novel coronavirus. ""Yes, people should embrace their pets. These researchers squirted the virus down the cats nose in high concentration, which is pretty artificial,"" said Dr. John Williams, chief of the division of pediatric infectious diseases at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. No realistic exposure The lab experiment used a scenario that is completely unrealistic, experts say. First, researchers forced extremely high doses of virus up the nostrils of five 8-month-old domesticated cats.  Cats in our homes or even in the wild would never be exposed to that level of virus. ""That's a whole lot more than an average human would get,"" said infectious disease expert Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of preventative medicine and infectious disease at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville. ""So this is an artificial circumstance and we don't know that it happens in nature at all,"" Schaffner added.  Two of the five cats were euthanized six days later. Researchers found virus particles in their upper respiratory systems. The remaining three infected cats were put into a cage adjacent to three non-infected cats. One of those three cats later tested positive for the virus, while the other two did not. Still, the researchers felt that showed the virus could be transmitted via respiratory drops. Or did it? None of the infected cats exhibited signs of illness. And even if they did pass the virus to each other, that doesn't mean they would be able to pass it on to humans.  That's what happened nearly two decades ago with a sister coronavirus called SARS-CoV, which causes the deadly pneumonia-like respiratory disease called SARS. Just like now, science found cats could be infected with SARS-CoV and infect other cats. But the virus didn't transmit widely among house cats during the 2002 to 2004 pandemic, nor were there any known cases of transmission to humans.  Ferrets affected too The study found ferrets were also ""efficient"" replicators of the virus -- meaning that the virus can easily grow and reproduce in their long, slinky bodies.  ""SARS-CoV-2 can replicate in the upper respiratory tract of ferrets for up to eight days, without causing severe disease or death,"" the study said. The study did not look at a longer time frame. That's good news for researchers looking for a way to test any future vaccines for SARS-CoV-2, also called the novel coronavirus. ""It's necessary to have an animal model to do initial tests of vaccines and understand how viruses cause disease. So, this will be useful to the field,"" Williams said. It's actually not surprising that ferrets appear to respond to the novel coronavirus. A ferret's lung and airways are strikingly similar to a human's. In fact, biologically and physiologically ferrets are more similar to humans than they are to a mouse or rat. ""Ferrets are classical animals in which to study influenza -- it's been done for decades,"" Schaffner said. ""If scientists were looking for an animal model, they would reach for the ferrets first."" What this means Will your cat or ferret come down with coronavirus? Highly unlikely, experts say, pointing to the fact that we would certainly have heard of many cases in pets by now, considering the significant spread of the virus in the US and Europe. Hong Kong has been quarantining animals belonging to people diagnosed with Covid-19 and have found only two cases of positive results in dogs. The dogs showed no signs of illness during the quarantine. Rare as it may be, it appears one cat in Belgium may have gotten the virus in March from her owner, who was ill with Covid-19 after returning from a visit to Italy. But even though the cat had respiratory problems and high levels of the virus in vomit and feces, researchers aren't yet sure if the cat was sick from Covid-19 or another illness. ""While 2 dogs (Hong Kong) and 1 cat (Belgium) have been reported to have been infected with SARS-CoV-2, infectious disease experts and multiple international and domestic human and animal health organizations agree there is no evidence at this point to indicate that pets spread COVID-19 to other animals, including people,"" the American Veterinary Medical Association says on its website. The AVMA and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend taking normal precautions when cleaning litter boxes and feeding animals.  ""Out of an abundance of caution,"" the AVMA suggests anyone ill with COVID-19 symptoms limit contact at this time, ""until more information is known about the virus."" ""Have another member of your household take care of walking, feeding, and playing with your pet,"" the AVMA states. ""If you have a service animal or you must care for your pet, then wear a facemask; don't share food, kiss, or hug them; and wash your hands before and after any contact with them."" "
Why Fauci is winning the battle for public trust,"Gil Eyal is a professor of sociology at Columbia University. His book, ""The Crisis of Expertise,"" was published by Polity Press in 2019. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN. (CNN)During a White House briefing on March 20, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, respectfully pushed back against President Donald Trump's claim that an anti-malaria drug would successfully treat coronavirus patients. The evidence was only anecdotal at that point, Fauci cautioned. Yet, just this week, the FDA provided ""emergency use approval"" to prescribe the drug to coronavirus patients.Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook On a different front, Trump said last week that he wanted the nation ""opened up and just raring to go by Easter,"" but later backed off, in part, after Fauci called this an ""aspirational projection"" and presented him with the likely estimates of fatalities.  As these exchanges unfolded in front of the press, it became clear that the President and the nation's foremost public health expert were battling, however politely, over who the American people should trust. While the scales may be tipping in Fauci's favor at the moment, the battle is far from won. The Covid-19 epidemic is a critical moment for the nation's public health experts. It is their credibility, no less than the political leaders', that is now on the line. And after years of declining levels of trust in experts, their handling of this crisis will either mark a restoration of the public's trust in experts -- or be the nail in their coffins. The Trump administration is known for its distrust of many experts. According to the Union of Concerned Scientists, the administration has sidelined independent experts' advice and often created a hostile working environment for government scientists whose research conflicted with its agenda. Defenders of the administration argue that the science in question -- for example, that on climate change and the regulations designed to slow its pace -- is inconclusive and that they are merely encouraging an intellectually honest approach. Yet it is hard to find many mainstream scientists who agree with that argument.  None of this is particularly surprising. Populists like Trump often detest experts. They call them ""elitists"" and ""globalists"" -- and imply that experts cannot be trusted. The irony of this moment -- with a world under siege by a lethal virus -- is that the legitimacy of populist politicians now depends on the professionalism and competence of the very experts they have denounced.  Yet skepticism about experts predates the Trump administration. One survey, documented in an Administrative Law Review paper, found that trust in the US Food and Drug Administration declined from 80% in the 1970s to 36% in 2006. And the assessments of experts regarding climate change, environmental pollution or vaccines have been fiercely contested for years. In other words, there is a systemic crisis of mistrust in experts. While it has multiple causes, it can be traced principally to interaction between two factors. First, experts are called upon to provide advice on contested matters that advantage some groups, while disadvantaging others. For example, when the FDA fast-tracks approval of one drug, it can enrich a pharmaceutical company and its investors -- as well as benefit a specific group of patients. At the same time, rejection can bankrupt another company and deny the hopes of other patients. In such a scenario, those who find themselves on the ""losing"" side may grow distrustful of the decision makers.  Second, unlike the exploratory nature of basic scientific research, government experts are tasked with formulating binding rules like ""acceptable levels"" of a pollutant. These are based on estimates that may reflect the state of the scientific art at one point in time -- but can quickly become obsolete. Initially, for example, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention discouraged Americans from wearing masks to combat the pandemic, and yet the CDC is now set to be reconsidering that initial recommendation.  In public perception, the combination of these two factors is potentially explosive. It can appear as if rules that allocate winners and losers were formulated on the basis of arbitrary cut-offs, or worse, are formulated to favor one group over another. But a crisis does not have to mean the ""death"" of expertise. Whatever problems beset expertise, the alternatives are worse.  A key issue now is who gets tested for Covid-19. Because tests are still scarce in some places, these decisions are made by infectious diseases experts. They take calls from clinicians, decide in each case whether to prioritize testing and revise guidelines as more kits become available. This is exactly how we would want such decisions to be made. An epidemic requires careful stewardship of scarce resources (such as ventilators and N95 masks) on the basis of expert assessments of relative risk. Yet for patients waiting in a long line only to be told that they cannot be tested, the decision can appear arbitrary. Most importantly, even when experts make decisions based on the best available evidence, inescapably they will sometimes be wrong, and when they do so, they will further undermine trust. Another case in point: the FDA's restrictive guidelines that in the early days of the epidemic allowed labs to conduct tests only for patients who met specific criteria, such as having recently traveled to Wuhan. In retrospect, it appears the guidelines may have caused many people carrying the virus and complaining about symptoms to go untested, and thereby masked the degree of community spread already taking place. But before we jump to denounce this as another case of rigid bureaucracy, we should realize that while the restrictions in this case may have been too strict, we need to have a set of guidelines to assist health care workers in their decision-making during an epidemic. If, in the early days of the virus, we did not have any guidelines, doctors may have given out tests to too many people who were suffering from allergies, the flu or other potentially less severe illnesses. And we could have found ourselves with no tests at all -- and an even harder time tracking an epidemic.  US public health experts are therefore entering this moment handicapped by the systemic crisis of mistrust in expertise. And, in the absence of trust, critics are ready to pounce at the slightest impression of political bias, either for the administration or against it.  On the other hand, the epidemic may work in the experts' favor, because in a moment of emergency we are predisposed to look to them for reassurance. And a skilled communicator like Fauci should be able to use this opportunity.    His performance up till now has reminded people that, despite the misgivings evoked by the administration's clumsy messaging, there are deep wells of professionalism, integrity and competence from which to draw among American public health experts. Reliance on them is our best bet, even if they make some mistakes "
"Some Americans could wait 20 weeks to receive stimulus checks, IRS tells House Democrats","Washington (CNN)Americans likely won't begin to see direct payments from the coronavirus stimulus bill until at least April 13 and it could take 20 weeks for all the checks to be mailed, Trump administration officials told lawmakers, according to a House Democratic memo obtained by CNN.CNN's Vivian Salama contributed to this report. The timeline means tens of millions of Americans will have to wait to get badly needed assistance, despite repeated earlier suggestions from Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin that the money would go out as soon as April 6.  Mnuchin said at Thursday's White House coronavirus briefing that payments would go out within two weeks to people whose direct deposit details are on file with the government, echoing comments he made this past Sunday after passage of the $2.2 trillion stimulus bill that payments would not go out until mid-April.  He added that a web portal would be established for people to supply their details and that checks would be sent to anyone else, but did not specify a timeline.  ""I am assuring the American public, they need the money now,"" he said.  CNN reported in March that former IRS officials said the wait would likely be weeks or months for payments. Initially, the IRS will make about 60 million payments, likely in the week of April 13, for taxpayers who provided their direct deposit information through their 2018 or 2019 tax returns, the memo from the House Ways and Means Committee says. Three weeks later, on the week of May 4, the IRS expects to start issuing paper checks to individuals whose bank information isn't already on file, a process that will take much longer. According to the committee, the paper checks will be issued at a rate of about 5 million per week, and that it could take up to 20 weeks to issue all the checks. Individuals with the lowest income, based on adjusted gross income, will receive their checks first. The Ways and Means Committee memo detailed its understanding of the timeline based on ""extensive"" conversations with Treasury and IRS officials. It said that the timelines are subject to change. The law stipulates that individuals who earn $75,000 or less will receive $1,200, and couples making $150,000 or less will receive twice that amount, with an additional $500 per child. The payments decrease for individuals and couples who make more money, with individuals who make more than $99,000 receiving nothing. Congressional aides were told last week when they were briefed by the IRS that roughly 150 million taxpayers will be eligible for the payments, but of those the IRS estimated they only had about 70 million people's direct deposit information on file. That means for roughly 80 million Americans, the IRS will have to rely on mailing checks. ""The Bureau of Fiscal Service estimates they can cut 20 million checks a month,"" a source familiar told CNN. The checks could take even longer to get to people for whom the IRS does not have tax information. The IRS envisions having an online system in place by late April or early May to allow taxpayers to update their direct deposit information and to track the status of their payments, according to the memo.

Pence expected to brief faith leaders in second coronavirus call in two weeks," (CNN)For at least the second time in two weeks, Vice President Mike Pence is expected to hold a conference call with faith leaders and other conservatives to bring them up to date on the rapidly changing coronavirus pandemic. A source who was on the last call, on March 23, told CNN that the first call involved about 20 people. Thursday's call is expected to include a much larger group. A senior administration official said it would include more than 500 ""grassroots leaders"" from across the country. The calls have been organized as part of Pence's ""public liaison function"" in his role leading the White House coronavirus task force. The content of the last call was described as ""not much different"" than the kind of information shared in the daily White House coronavirus briefings. On the first call, Pence talked about President Donald Trump's social distancing guidelines to stress to people ""if we do this we can have a better outcome."" ""A lot of this is desire to have an additional communication portal to get the word out,"" the source said.   A White House official said the administration has been hosting routine calls with various groups including inter-faith, nonprofits, small businesses, industries, military families and veterans.  ""The President and his administration are committed to getting the latest health information and CDC guidelines to as many communities as possible to help slow the spread of the virus,"" the official added. Churches and religious groups have been areas of particular interest for the administration because of the high amount of support for both Trump and Pence in the evangelical community, and Covid-19 presents special challenges for faith leaders.  Last month, a pastor at a Louisiana church was charged for continuing to hold services, defying a local bans on gatherings of 50 or more people. And in Florida, an evangelical pastor was arrested for holding large services at Tampa megachurch. Asked if conservative faith leaders were concerned about those reports, the source said ""no one is happy about the fact that churches are closed -- though (we don't know) what happened with those guys in Tampa and Louisiana."" In some places, the churches have beenexempted from social distancing guidelines because of first amendment freedom of religion considerations. But in the last call Pence adhered to discussing the ""virus and the guidelines."" Publicly, the vice president has thanked the faith community in recent days for adhering to those guidelines. ""We're so grateful to churches and synagogues and places of worship around America that have heeded the President's coronavirus guidelines for America,"" Pence told ABC news on Wednesday, referring to federal recommendations that encourage people to keep a distance from one another and not hold large gatherings. ""We really believe this is a time when people should avoid gatherings of more than 10 people,"" Pence had said. ""And, and so, we continue to urge churches around America to heed to that."" The upside for most churches that expect to remain closed from Palm Sunday, which occurs this weekend, through Holy Week, Maundy Thursday, Good Friday and Easter next week, is that churches that offer streaming video and audio of their services have seen their audiences skyrocket. Some of that may be due to the President himself. In a tweet last month, Trump pushed audiences toward online services. ""Tomorrow I have called for a National Day of Prayer. I will be tuning in to Pastor @Jentezen at the @FreeChapel Church in Gainesville, Georgia at 11:00 AM EDT. God Bless the USA!,"" he tweeted, with a link to the services. "
"Passengers to be allowed off Zaandam, Rotterdam cruise ships in Florida"," (CNN)A pair of cruise ships carrying passengers with flu-like symptoms docked in Florida's Port Everglades on Thursday evening, ending a nightmarish voyage disrupted by the coronavirus pandemic. CNN's Jennifer Henderson and Denise Royal contributed to this report.  An agreement between the cruise line and local and federal authorities will allow healthy passengers to go home while the sick remain on board for treatment, according to Broward County officials.  After days of uncertainty over their final destination, the Zaandam and Rotterdam cruise ships will have passengers disembark Thursday night at the Fort Lauderdale port, Broward County Commissioner Barbara Sharief said Thursday.  Fort Lauderdale Mayor Dean Trantalis sought to allay community concerns over the possible spread of the virus. ""Holland America agreed to a strict set set of protocols if the county decided to allow the ships to dock,"" he said via Twitter Thursday afternoon, referring to the agreement involving the cruise line, U.S. Coast Guard, Homeland Security, state and federal health officials and Broward County. ""Given the county's decision to allow the ships here, I believe these regulations present a humanitarian solution for those on board while providing strong safeguards for our community,"" the mayor said. The Zaandam's South American itinerary changed dramatically when nine passengers tested positive for Covid-19 and four men died on board. Sharief said the men were over the age of 70 -- two had been diagnosed with Covid-19, one suffered a heart attack and another succumbed to a preexisting illness. Broward County Mayor Dale Holness told reporters that 26 passengers with possible coronovirus symptoms will remain on the ships. Additionally, 13 passengers and one crew member will be treated at a local hospital. At one time more than 200 guests and crew had flu-like symptoms. Holness said about 1,200 guests ""deemed well and fit to travel,"" per CDC guidelines, will be given masks and transported by private buses directly to the tarmac at Fort Lauderdale International Airport for five charter flights home Friday night and Saturday. They will undergo two layers of health screening.  Nearly 40 Florida residents will receive transportation to their home and be required to self quarantine for 14 days, Holness said.  ""Our top consideration is the health of our community as well as those on board,"" he said. ""It shows the good side of Broward County."" Holland America said late Wednesday that it had secured a local health system to treat the fewer than 10 people in need of immediate critical care onshore. The Broward Health Hospital System confirmed Thursday that critically ill patients from the Zaandam would be transferred there, according to spokeswoman Jennifer Smith.  ""Prepare to disembark"" was the long-awaited, reassuring message delivered to passengers by the captain of the Rotterdam, the Zaandam's sister ship, on Thursday morning, according to passenger Laura Gabaroni. Some 200 passengers hail from countries requiring connecting flights to get home, Sharief said.  Passengers on the Zaandam include 311 US citizens from 46 states, including 52 Floridians. Broward residents among them have agreed to isolate for an additional 14 days at home. The rest from from countries ranging from Canada to the UK to Australia. Broward County Commissioner Michael Udine Thursday expressed frustration that the decision over the ships' final port was left mostly in the hand of local officials. He said he had to field calls from consul generals from other countries in the past few days. On Wednesday night, the British-American cruise line called the plight of those on board a ""humanitarian situation.""  It made a last-ditch appeal to federal and local authorities to allow the cruise ships to disembark in the Port of Everglades. ""Holland America Line calls for compassion and reason in the review and approval of our disembarkation plan by Florida officials,"" the cruise line said in a statement. The appeal came hours after Gov. Ron DeSantis said his state was willing to accept Floridians on board the cruise ships. There are 808 guests and 583 crew on the Rotterdam and 442 guests and 603 crew on the Zaandam, according to Holland America.  DeSantis expressed concerns about taking in others given the state's limited hospital beds. The Zaandam, on which four guests have died since it departed Argentina's capital March 7, is among more than a dozen cruise ships stranded at sea as ports deny entry and passengers panic about returning home. 'They need to get to land'  The Zaandam began transiting the Panama Canal late Sunday after being docked off Panama for several days. The boat and its occupants have been in limbo for weeks awaiting permission to disembark after several South American ports denied the ship's entry. The US Coast Guard, in a marine safety information bulletin issued Sunday, said an increase in foreign passenger vessels requiring medical evacuations was straining local medical resources.  Passengers have ""better access to comfortable surroundings and medical staff on board the foreign passenger vessel where care is already being provided,"" according to the bulletin. Jennifer Allan said her mother, Gloria Weed, 70, and father, Bill Weed, 75, have been quarantined in their cabin aboard the Zaandam in what she described as ""solitary confinement.""  ""My dad has developed pneumonia,"" she told CNN this week. ""He's getting worse. They need to get to land. They need to get medical attention sooner rather than later."" Allan said her parents, who live in Sarasota, Florida, came down with a fever about 10 days ago. She described the efforts of the Zaandam crew members to care for passengers as ""extraordinary"" even though many are themselves sick.  No one has left the ship since it stopped in Punta Arenas, Chile, on March 14. Guests were originally told they could disembark in Chile for flights, but ultimately that was forbidden. Holland America deployed the Rotterdam to offer relief. Rotterdam met Zaandam off Panama on March 26 to ""provide extra supplies, staff, Covid-19 test kits and other support as needed."" Holland America transferred healthy Zaandam guests to Rotterdam. "
Democratic National Convention pushed back to August,"Washington (CNN)The Democratic National Convention has been pushed back to the week of August 17 in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, the committee tasked with planning the event announced on Thursday.CNN's Kaitlan Collins and Sarah Westwood contributed to this report. The change represents a dramatic shift for the party, which has worked for months to host a convention in Milwaukee in mid-July. While officials began planning for contingencies in the face of the spreading coronavirus, many had remained hopeful that the virus would abate and allow Democrats to host the supremely important event. Representatives for former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' campaigns were consulted on the decision to move the Democratic National Convention from July to August, two Democratic officials tell CNN. Biden currently holds a significant lead over Sanders in the nomination fight and is the party's frontrunner. Democrats had initially picked the mid-July date as a way to hold their convention before the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. But when the Olympics were delayed by a year due to the coronavirus, the three weeks spanning July and August were open for what Democrats hope will be a major media moment. Politics in the United States has been forced to make wholesale changes due to the spread of the coronavirus, including multiple states postponing primaries and a virtual halt of all in-person campaigning. The Democratic convention will now happen the week immediately before the Republican convention in Charlotte. ""In our current climate of uncertainty, we believe the smartest approach is to take additional time to monitor how this situation unfolds so we can best position our party for a safe and successful convention,"" Joe Solmonese, CEO of the convention, said Thursday. ""During this critical time, when the scope and scale of the pandemic and its impact remain unknown, we will continue to monitor the situation and follow the advice of health care professionals and emergency responders."" Top Democrats began actively considering a range of contingency plans for the party's convention last month, including changing the date, shortening the in-person portion of the gathering or going entirely digital. Those efforts sped up in recent days as former Vice President Joe Biden, who is leading in the delegate count, began to publicly call for changes to the convention planning, including saying on Wednesday that he thinks the convention will ""have to move into August."" ""I doubt whether the Democratic Convention is going to be able to be held in mid-July or early July. I think it's going to have to move into August,"" the former vice president told Jimmy Fallon on ""The Tonight Show"" Wednesday night. ""We just have to be prepared for the alternative and the alternative, we don't know what it's going to be unless we have a better sense of whether this curve is going to move down or up."" The change does create a series of problems for the planning committee, which has already locked in the convention venue and needed hotels for the influx of visitors. Convention planners said on Thursday that the venue, the Fiserv Forum, and hotel accommodations in area are all still available in August. Pressure was mounting on organizers as similar summer events, like the Olympics, began to be postponed or canceled. There was also an acknowledgment that conventions are not nimble organizations and any significant changes would take at least four weeks for organizers to fully implement. The delay in the convention also puts off any consideration of changing the convention rules to allow delegates to cast their votes remotely. Current convention rules dictate that delegates have to appear in person to nominate a candidate, so a rule change would be needed in order to allow votes to be cast digitally. Biden and Sanders' campaigns were notified of the plan to move the convention date on Thursday morning, a Democratic official tells CNN. ""The convention team has been contingency planning in light of the developing health crisis for the past couple of weeks. We notified both campaigns this morning of our decision to move,"" the official said. The same official tells CNN that both Biden and Sanders' campaigns supported the decision to move the convention. ""They agreed it was the best decision in light of the health crisis facing the country,"" the official said. One key issue in moving the convention was the venue -- the Fiserv Forum, the new home of the NBA's Milwaukee Bucks. Alex Lasry, senior vice president for the Bucks and chair of the Milwaukee's bid for the convention, tells CNN that the arena is available for the week. ""This is the right decision for the safety of those involved in the convention and for Milwaukee,"" Lasry said. ""An August convention will provide a much-needed economic boost for Milwaukee and Wisconsin as we come out of this unprecedented time."" Members of the party's powerful Rules & Bylaws Committee had begun to look at possible contingency plans, but had not actively begun talking about rules changes. ""Are we talking about rule changes right now? No, we are not. Will be two months from now? Maybe,"" Maria Cardona, a longtime Democratic operative and member of the committee, told CNN last week. ""Are we looking for possible contingency plans about what something like that will look like? Yes, there are people looking at what that would entail."" Republicans, too, have been under pressure to consider changes to their convention, but benefited from the fact that they had initially picked late August for their meeting. ""The RNC is working closely with state parties, ensuring that they have the resources needed to get their presidential nomination processes done, and offering incredible flexibility in these circumstances,"" Mandi Merritt, a spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee, said on Thursday. ""We are fully committed to holding the Republican convention in Charlotte as planned and re-nominating President Trump."" This story has been updated with additional information.  "

Homeless during a pandemic: Dr. Sanjay Gupta's coronavirus podcast for April 2," (CNN)How do you stay at home if you are homeless? CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta looks at how cities across the US are handling the homeless crisis during coronavirus and why everyone's health matters. Angela Hernandez: I don't ever eat in the shelter. I usually go outside to the soup kitchens. But since a lot of the soup kitchens have closed down, there's very limited places that anybody can go to get a meal.  Dr. Sanjay Gupta: That's Angela Hernandez. She's one of 150 women living at a woman's shelter in New York City. Angela has been homeless on and off since 2005.  Angela Hernandez: The soup kitchens, they're very low on their distribution. All they give now are just one sandwich and a piece of fruit. Dr. Gupta: As most of America is asked to stay at home during this outbreak, there is a group of people who cannot: the homeless. And they are some of the most vulnerable in our population.   In today's episode, we'll hear from advocates across the country about how their cities are scrambling to address the homeless crisis during coronavirus.  This is a problem that impacts all of us and never before has it been more evident than in the midst of a pandemic.   I'm Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's Chief Medical Correspondent, and this is ""Coronavirus: Fact vs. Fiction.""     Hernandez: Here in this shelter, there's no supplies for anything like toilet paper, soap, hand sanitizer ... those kind of things.  Dr. Gupta: Angela has been living at her shelter for more than two years now. We asked her to walk us through what life is like there.   Hernandez: You know, there is nothing sanitized. They don't clean every day, so we only get cleaning services maybe once a week. The rooms consist of maybe two or three or four or five in each room. And there's no way to distance yourself from anyone. You know, the beds are like 3 feet apart.  Dr. Gupta: Angela says she has a friend in another shelter who got the virus from his roommates. He was hospitalized but has now recovered.  Hernandez: This really scary feeling when you don't know who may be sick and you're under such close proximity to each other. Dr. Gupta: New York City has the largest homeless population in the country.    Some, like Angela, live in a shelter, while others are forced to live on the streets or subways.   Giselle Routhier, Coalition for the Homeless: Right now, obviously, New York City is probably the epicenter of the crisis. But we also have record numbers of people who are homeless in New York City, and that is a problem that predates this epidemic. Even before all of this started, we have over 60,000 people sleeping in shelters every single night. Dr. Gupta: That's Giselle Routhier, policy director at Coalition for the Homeless, a nonprofit based in New York City.   Routhier: Guidance coming directly from health professionals is saying quarantine at home, stay at home, stay away from other people. And that's literally impossible to do if you're someone who is experiencing homelessness. You don't have your own place to go.  Dr. Gupta: Many places, like gyms and public libraries, where people on the streets used to access bathrooms and showers, have now closed.    On top of housing and sanitation, access to proper food is also a challenge.   The coalition for the homeless runs a mobile soup kitchen every night. But because many other services have shut down, there's even more of a demand.   Routhier: We have vans going now to folks on the streets handing out hot meals. But because we are still operating and one of the few people that are, the number of people that are coming to us is has vastly increased. And so we're seeing the dire need on the streets every single night. And so this is extraordinarily urgent.   Dr. Gupta: Already, more than a hundred people who are homeless in New York City have tested positive for the coronavirus. Five have died.   It's not just exposure. People who are homeless also tend to have more health problems, putting them at greater risk if they do become infected with the virus.   Randall Kuhn, an associate professor of public health at the University of California Los Angeles, recently co-authored a report about how the novel coronavirus would affect the homeless population in the United States.   Randall Kuhn, UCLA: The aging curve for a homeless person is accelerated by 15, possibly 20 years. So in other words, we see all these graphs about how people over age 80 are at extreme risk of mortality due to Covid-19. That would be the same risk curve for a 65-year-old homeless person. Dr. Gupta: While many of the people who are homeless in New York live in shelters, in Los Angeles, the situation is the opposite.   Kuhn: Roughly 75% of the homeless population is unsheltered on any given night, meaning they're living on the street, the sidewalk or in an encampment or in a vehicle.   Dr. Gupta: A source with knowledge of the situation says that one homeless shelter exposed to the virus could overwhelm two or three hospitals.   And as the fight for personal protective equipment, or PPE, throughout the country continues, homeless shelters are often at the bottom of the list -- after emergency rooms and first responders.   Here's Giselle Routhier again. Routhier: I mean, when it comes to people who are homeless, we are nowhere near where we need to be in terms of the response. We don't have enough isolation beds. Staff and isolation facilities don't have access to PPE. And there's just a lot of chaos and not enough real solutions that are coming on quickly enough.   Dr. Gupta: Just last week in Las Vegas, a shelter housing 500 homeless people was forced to close after one man tested positive for coronavirus.    City and county officials created a makeshift homeless shelter ... in a parking lot. They marked out boxes on the ground so people could sleep 6 feet apart. I saw a picture of the situation, and it's very unsettling.   As the government and community organizations scramble to navigate the outbreak, advocates say finding shelter for people on the streets is a top priority.    Routhier: I mean, first and foremost, we need to get people into safe spaces where they can isolate to either prevent themselves from becoming infected or to recover if they are already exposed and infected.  Dr. Gupta: In the meantime, we're seeing organizations and individuals who are stepping in with creative solutions to help.   In Atlanta, a nonprofit called Love Beyond Walls has been installing portable sinks for those on the streets to wash their hands.  Terence Lester, Love Beyond Walls: We kept hearing, ""Man, I'm scared I'm going to catch this virus because I don't have anywhere to wash my hands."" They don't have the privilege to self-preserve or even to walk over to a sink. And I don't know, my heart just goes out.  Dr. Gupta: In Pittsburgh, Dr. Jim Withers and his team have been going out into the streets to check in on people.   Dr. Jim Withers, Street Medicine Institute: So, I'm out here with a team today, and we're actually doing screens for the Covid virus, as well as assessing people's needs. It's very important, I think, to not forget members of our community that may not be able to make it to standard testing areas.   Dr. Gupta: In Seattle, the county purchased a former motel to isolate victims who didn't need hospitalization, including the homeless. And since many hotels are now vacant, advocates in New York City and Los Angeles are calling on government officials to use them.   Routhier: There's about 100,000 hotel rooms that are vacant in New York City that we need to be using right away to help house the homeless population.   Kuhn: And then the next big question is then once you've got a lot of people in hotels, we can't just suddenly decide one day to kick them out because the economy is working well. We want to think about a way to have this be a path to durable shelter solutions.   Dr. Gupta: As part of the recent $2 trillion stimulus package, the government is allocating $4 billion to state and local governments for homeless assistance.   Homeless advocates say, though, this is just a short-term solution. And what they really need is sustainable housing options. Routhier: Crisis has really highlighted the fact that housing is health care and connected these two issues in ways that perhaps people did not previously understand. And so what we can best hope for moving forward is that people now understand how not only how traumatic it is to be homeless but how actually dangerous it is to be homeless and that we can work towards permanent solutions.  Dr. Gupta: I've said it again and again over the past several weeks, but it still rings true. Never before have we been so dependent on one another for our health.    We'll be back tomorrow. Thanks for listening. "
'Contagion' vs. coronavirus: The film's connections to a real life pandemic," (CNN)As we live through a developing pandemic, some of us can't help but compare it to the 2011 American thriller which some claim predicted Covid-19: ""Contagion.""Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.CNN's Nick Paton Walsh, Vasco Cotovio, Sandee LaMotte, Jen Christensen and Arman Azad contributed to this report.  Directed by Steven Soderbergh and written by Scott Z. Burns, the film follows the spread of a virus transmitted when sick humans touch surfaces and leave virus behind that others can catch. Next comes the frantic attempts by public health officials to identify and contain the disease, the anarchy that unfolds amid a pandemic, and the ultimate introduction of a vaccine to stop the spread. Sound like a plot we're in the middle of? Its prescience was bolstered by Burns consulting with representatives of the World Health Organization on the ins and outs of infectious diseases, and by Kate Winslet working with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to understand the lifestyle and character of an epidemiologist charged with leading the world through crisis. The filmmakers also consulted medical experts including Dr. W. Ian Lipkin and Lawrence ""Larry"" Brilliant. Lipkin is the director of the Center for Infection and Immunity at Columbia University Mailman School of Health. He recently contracted the novel coronavirus.   Laurie Garrett also served as a consultant on the film because she wrote the 1994 book ""The Coming Plague"" and reported on multiple pandemics. In a 2001 article she wrote for CNN, Garrett described ""Contagion""as ""part fantasy, part reality and totally possible.""  Here is how the virus and drama of ""Contagion"" compares with the real life coronavirus pandemic as it currently stands.  Virus origins The final scene in ""Contagion"" reveals that the fictional ""MEV-1"" virus originated from a pig that ate a piece of banana dropped by an infected bat escaping the destruction of its palm tree forest habitat in China.  That pig is then slaughtered and prepared by a chef who, without washing them first, shakes hands with Beth Emhoff (played by Gwyneth Paltrow), thus transmitting the virus to her. Emhoff becomes the ""index case,"" meaning she was the first identified case.    The origin of the novel coronavirus terrorizing us today is still a mystery to scientists. It will only be solved if they're able to isolate the live virus in a suspected species (like in the movie), which can be difficult.   However, like ""Contagion,"" bats are considered by some epidemiologists to be the possible source of the coronavirus.  Zoologists, ecologists and disease experts have told CNN that human behaviors -- such as destroying natural habitats -- might be to blame for the transfer of the disease. When bats are stressed, which can occur from destruction of their habitats, their typically strong immune system is challenged, which makes it harder to cope with pathogens they could usually fight off. This allows an increase in infections and the shedding of them. One theory on the origin of the current coronavirus is that the initial epicenter was likely a ""wet market"" in Wuhan, China. In ""wet markets,"" wild animals that also may be infected and stressed are held together and sold as food or pets, leading to a mix of viruses and species.  Any ""zoonotic spillover,"" or the transfer of disease from animals to humans, is exacerbated by population density and public transport, which make it easy for a virus to spread rapidly.  Scientists studying the spread of the coronavirus have provided another theory: It may have spread into humans from animals in a less deadly form and circulated at low levels in humans for years before adapting to us and becoming seriously infectious, according to recent research published in the journal Nature Medicine.  If the ""Contagion"" bats were under stress from the palm tree destruction, the origin of the ""Contagion"" virus could mirror the potential origin of the current coronavirus.  Similar symptoms Sick people in the film experienced fevers and profuse sweating, pounding headaches, sore throat and cough but also had seizures, dizziness and frothed at the mouth when they passed.  The signs of the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, Covid-19 are similar, but there haven't been any reports of seizures or frothing at the mouth. Covid-19 symptoms include primarily a fever of at least 100 degrees Fahrenheit (37.7 degrees Celsius), cough or trouble breathing, according to the CDC.  Emergency warning signs of Covid-19 include ""persistent pain or pressure in the chest,"" ""bluish lips or face"" -- indicating a lack of oxygen -- and sudden mental confusion, fatigue or inability to rouse.  Less common symptoms of Covid-19 include those typically experienced during flu and cold: headaches, digestive issues, body aches and fatigue, and a runny nose, sore throat and sneezing.  Anosmia, a lack of sense of smell, and dygeusia, a lack of taste, are symptoms that might flag Covid-19 in its early stages among patients with a mild case.  Transmission Like Covid-19, the film's MEV-1 is a respiratory disease, carried in expelled droplets of saliva from a sneeze or cough or other secretions. It spreads directly between people when those droplets reach the eyes, nose or mouth of an uninfected person. The film's virus is also transmitted by fomites, or surfaces that have been contaminated with infections after sick humans touch them.  The spreading of MEV-1 is exacerbated by the average person touching their face a few thousand times per day -- while in between, they're touching door handles, elevator buttons, subway poles and each other.  Evidence shows that the novel coronavirus transmits through the same mechanisms, according to the World Health Organization.  Actors from ""Contagion"" recently urged people to ""control the contagion"" by washing their hands, practicing social distancing and following the advice of health experts In a series of PSAs from Columbia Public Health.  Can you be immune to the virus? The fictional Mitch Emhoff (played by Matt Damon), husband of index case Beth, is found to be immune to the virus. He dodges the deliberately targeted coughs of strangers in grocery stores and survives through the film physically unscathed.  Today, there are no reports of people biologically immune to getting the novel coronavirus. But can one be immune to the novel coronavirus after recovering from it? Scientists aren't sure yet.  In the March 26 CNN Global Town Hall: Coronavirus Facts and Fears, CNN anchor Anderson Cooper asked physician Dr. Leana Wen whether a person can be immune to the virus via antibodies they developed after having and recovering from the disease.  ""This is what we want to get to,"" she responded. ""We don't have that test yet. It's being developed. But that would be great. It would be so helpful for people to know whether they have immunity.""  And if someone could be immune, we don't yet know how long it could last for.  ""There are some people who speculate that one might have immunity for a long time, even forever, but we just don't know yet,"" she added.  The R0 The number of people a sick person is likely to infect is called the R0, or R-naught, of a virus. The R0 of the fictional MEV-1 virus was 4, while the R0 of coronavirus is 2.2, according to a recent study of data from the first cases of Covid-19 in Wuhan and investigations conducted by Chinese and American health officials.  They found the epidemic doubled about every seven days. In other words, on average, each Covid-19 patient transmits the infection to an additional 2.2 people.  The mortality rate  The mortality rate of the ""Contagion"" virus, or the percentage of those that die among an infected population, was estimated to be about 25% to 30%. As of March 26, the mortality rate among patients with Covid-19 is between 1.8% to 3.4%, according to the CDC.  An unproven remedy: Forsythia vs. chloroquine  In ""Contagion,"" blogger Alan Krumwiede (Jude Law) pushes forsythia, a floral homeopathic tincture, as the cure for the virus, although studies hadn't proved it worked. He appeared to have recovered from the virus shortly after taking forsythia, and anxious customers clamored for prescriptions of the remedy from their local pharmacies as well as on Krumwiede's blog. He attracted more 12 million followers and several million dollars from the false claim, according to the film. Law, in the production notes for the film, described his character as the ""'index patient' for what becomes a parallel epidemic of fear and panic"" based on mistrust of news media, the government and health officials.   There are currently no cures or vaccines for Covid-19, yet the drugs chloroquine and its analog hydroxychloroquine have been called ""game changers"" by President Donald Trump. Both drugs are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to treat malaria and other conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus.  A man living in Phoenix died and his wife was in critical care after the two took a non-pharmaceutical version of chloroquine in an attempt to prevent contracting the virus. His wife said he heard Trump tout the drug in a news conference.  On March 29, the FDA issued a limited emergency use authorization for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine to treat patients hospitalized with Covid-19.  Despite limited evidence on the efficacy of the drugs for Covid-19, the US Department of Human Health Services said in a statement that anecdotal reports suggest they may be beneficial in the treatment of hospitalized patients. The FDA said the benefits outweigh the risks.  A path toward a vaccine  In ""Contagion,"" CDC research scientist Dr. Ally Hextall (Jennifer Ehle) stresses that it can take months, maybe a year, to be able to distribute a vaccine after testing, clinical trials, manufacturing and distribution. However, Hextall speeds up the process by inoculating herself with the final experimental vaccine, then is able to provide doses for human use in just several months. In reality, leading infectious disease experts say the typical vaccine takes between 8 and 10 years to develop. American health officials are trying to fast track that time frame, as are laboratories around the world.  Currently a year to 18 months is an optimistic time window for a possible coronavirus vaccine, Dr. Peter Hotez, a leading expert on infectious disease and vaccine development at Baylor College of Medicine, previously told CNN.  That said, a novel coronavirus vaccine Phase I trial in the US gave the first dose to test the safety of the vaccine to a participant in March. This trial is meant to establish that the vaccine is safe and that participants immune systems respond well, but proving the vaccine effectively prevents infection will take many more months.  Life as we haven't known it  In ""Contagion,"" civil unrest rips at the fabric of society, leaving banks and grocery stores ransacked. Police seemed unable to respond to crime, as martial law prohibited travel between states to stop the spread of the virus.  That hasn't happened in real life. But, as in the film, a lot of us have spent weeks separated from friends, family and places we love, wondering when the pandemic will end so we can get back to life as we've known it. People are under variations of restrictions on movement, including social distancing guidelines, shelter-in-place and stay-at-home orders. On March 29, Trump extended social distancing guidelines to April 30.  In one of the final scenes of the film, after successful distribution of vaccines, people wait in an airport to board their flight. Some still wear masks, but when a man in line drops something, the man behind him touches his shoulder to catch his attention, then leans down to pick the item up for him. The man seems grateful. Naivety? Or, maybe it's a sign that the worst is behind them. Fictional CDC head Dr. Ellis Cheever (Laurence Fishburne) gives the son of a CDC custodian his own intranasal vaccine near the end of the film. The boy hesitantly shakes Cheever's hand, expressing his gratitude.  ""You know where this comes from, shaking hands?"" Cheever asked. ""It was a way of showing a stranger that you weren't carrying a weapon in the old days. You offered your empty right hand to show that you meant no harm."" If there are any concrete takeaways ""Contagion"" offers us, it's a reminder to stop touching your face, and a beacon of hope that this too shall pass.  We can only hope we will one day be able to reach out and touch again, thankful that our pandemic is over.  "
How sensitive work in Congress is being impeded by the coronavirus pandemic,"Washington (CNN)President Donald Trump warned Wednesday that Iran or its proxies may be planning a ""sneak attack"" against US forces, but some lawmakers say they can't evaluate the intelligence behind that assertion because the coronavirus outbreak has limited their access to classified material. With Congress all but shut down, the details of the potential Iranian threat are on a growing list of sensitive issues that members of Congress are not being informed about because the growing pandemic has made the communication of classified information much more difficult, if not impossible. Some lawmakers say the current situation has even hindered their ability to access classified information related to how foreign rivals are likely working to exploit the coronavirus outbreak to help achieve their own objectives, meaning they are having to rely on publicly available information and statements from administration officials. ""I haven't had access to or seen anything on the classified side,"" said Representative Mike Gallagher, a member of the House Armed Services Committee, told CNN Tuesday in a phone interview from his home in Wisconsin. ""It's just kind of what I've seen from my basement."" Gallagher, like so many other lawmakers and their staffs, have left Washington to ride out the pandemic at home. That makes it impossible for them to attend classified briefings or make secure calls in the Capitol's secure rooms known as Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility, or SCIFs. Making calls on less secure phone lines at home or elsewhere also means it's not possible to discuss topics that require a security clearance. ""There are serious concerns about escalation with Iran, war powers, and military actions that's happening in Iraq,"" a senior Senate aide said. ""We are setting up regular calls with [the State Department] on this but there's only so much we can do on open lines."" Concern administration will take advantage  The slower workarounds and inability to brief and communicate classified information has meant that the committees' oversight role has been hindered, multiple aides told CNN. It has also led to concern among Democrats that the Trump administration will take advantage of a lack of accountability during the pandemic. ""We have learned not to trust this administration with anything,"" a congressional foreign policy aide said. ""The risk of that definitely increases as time goes on. It's just a continuing list of things, a backlog of issues small and large that we have yet to be briefed on that becomes more and more of a risk."" There are numerous SCIFs for both the House and Senate, with individual rooms for the Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Armed Services committees in each chamber. They're operating on skeleton crews and the typical number of people in a briefing runs counter to social distancing guidelines. Intelligence officials maintain they are responding to specific requests from lawmakers but they need to be in a secure facility to receive them. Setting up a secure call in a SCIF is difficult with fewer staff since the calls usually involve numerous people who themselves all need to be on secure lines which most don't have when working from home. The disruption to staff work for the Senate Intelligence Committee has been limited, said Rachel Cohen, a spokesperson for ranking member Mark Warner.  Like the intelligence agencies they oversee like the CIA and NSA, committee staffers are working in shifts to keep the office staffed while reducing the number of people in the offices, Cohen said. Staff in the office do have access to the secure facilities while Warner and the chairman, Richard Burr, as the leadership, have access to classified communications wherever they are. 'Challenges' But, Cohen acknowledged, ""members themselves will have some challenges."" The House Intelligence Committee SCIF was deep cleaned after one of the staff was diagnosed with Covid-19, a committee official said. Chairman Adam Schiff has told staff to work at home but instructed them to go to the office if they need a classified briefing or to review classified information, a committee official said. Schiff himself went to the Capitol twice last week for a briefing and to review material. ""We're also in touch with the [intelligence community] to make sure that they're keeping us as up to date as possible, and to keep us informed as to when we need to go into the SCIF to view important updates,"" the official added. When the family of former FBI agent Robert Levinson announced last week that they had been told by administration officials that new information indicated he died after years in captivity in Iran, a classified briefing for lawmakers on that new intelligence lawmakers did not take place. The circumstances around the death of the longest-held American in history is classified information that was not known before and would have been requested in a briefing, the foreign policy aide said. Now, however, committees can't summon State Department and intelligence officials to get the answers they want -- and would argue they need -- as part of their oversight responsibilities. The foreign policy aide estimated that the new Levinson intelligence is one of around a dozen topics aren't getting the attention they deserve, including specifics about US embassy personnel drawdowns and the deployment of Patriot missile batteries to Iraq in light of the threat from neighboring Iran. ""We have totally been hampered and it has impacted our work quite negatively,"" the aide said. "
Pelosi announces House committee on coronavirus crisis to exercise oversight of pandemic response,"Washington (CNN)House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Thursday announced the creation of a new bipartisan House select committee on the coronavirus crisis that will exercise oversight of the federal response to the pandemic and be chaired by Majority Whip Jim Clyburn.Maegan Vazquez and Kevin Liptak contributed to this story.  The speaker told reporters on a conference call that the committee's immediate focus will be on ""the here and now,"" not the Trump administration's initial response to the pandemic, though she said there will come a time when such a review will be appropriate. She said the committee will ""have an expert staff and the committee will be empowered to examine all aspects of the federal response to coronavirus and to ensure that the taxpayers dollars are being wisely and efficiently spent to save lives, deliver relief, and benefit our economy."" Pelosi said the committee will be able to exercise oversight and would have the authority to issue subpoenas.  ""It's no use having a committee unless you have subpoena power,"" she said. ""We would hope there would be cooperation,"" she added. ""We want to make sure there are not exploiters out there.""  While Pelosi has the power to propose the formation of such a select committee, the House must vote on a resolution to actually create it, according to the House rules. But that's unlikely to happen in the near term given that the House is not expected to have any votes before April 20, and when exactly the House will return is still uncertain. Pelosi also discussed her view that Congress will need to take further legislative action to deal with the crisis.  ""Every day we see the need for further action,"" she said, adding, ""House Democrats have continued our work in daily conference calls with our frontline personnel and each other,"" she said.  House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy reiterated on Thursday that he disagrees with Pelosi's push to craft a fourth coronavirus response bill, saying Congress should instead be focused on making sure the first three bills are implemented well. A fourth stimulus bill ""is not appropriate at this time,"" he said during a phone call with reporters.  ""I'm for infrastructure in the future,"" McCarthy said, but he wants to ensure it is ""targeted, that it works."" Asked about President Donald Trump's support for a large infrastructure package to boost the economy, McCarthy said Trump would also ""want it to be targeted and timely."" McCarthy also criticized Pelosi's decision to form a House select committee on the coronavirus crisis, arguing that such a committee would be ""redundant"" because existing House committees are able to exercise oversight, and there are other oversight provisions in the coronavirus legislation that has been passed. McCarthy also said he's concerned that Clyburn will be heading the committee. ""Congressman Clyburn is the one who thought that this crisis is an opportune time to restructure government. That's not what we should be doing,"" the California Republican said.  McCarthy cautioned that getting the select committee up and running would require a House vote.  ""I don't know when we'd go back and vote on this. I don't know what the budget would be. I don't know what the responsibility would be. And I'm just wondering, does the speaker not trust the Oversight Committee?"" he said. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said later Thursday that he does not support the creation of a select committee either. Asked during the White House press briefing whether he thought the committee was necessary, Mnuchin said, ""I don't."" ""Both parties wanted us to have oversight, wanted us to have transparency. We have full transparency,"" he said, referring to the oversight panel created as part of the stimulus package. ""And again, that committee will review the money that we're spending,"" Mnuchin added. President Donald Trump also criticized the formation of such a committee. ""Here we go again,"" Trump griped at Thursday's news conference as he bemoaned ""witch hunt after witch hunt after witch hunt."" ""It's time to get this enemy defeated. Conducting these partisan investigations in a pandemic is a big waste of vital resources, time, attention,"" Trump said. When asked if she would support a commission to investigate what unfolded in the onset of the crisis, Pelosi said she that is ""a big supporter of after-action review,"" and there is ""absolutely"" a need for one in this case.  She said it's ""something that we should discuss"" and it would have to be bipartisan. Anything that affects this many Americans, she added, needs an after-action review — ""not to point fingers, but to ensure that it doesn't happen again in the manner in which it happened."" ""Right now, we just have to work together to get through this. But as we do, we don't want to make more mistakes,"" she said. The creation of the panel comes after Congress passed a massive and far-reaching stimulus package with an estimated price tag of roughly $2 trillion to respond to the economic and public health fallout from the rapid spread of the devastating disease.  The legislation stands as the largest emergency aid package in US history and represents a massive financial injection into a struggling economy with provisions aimed at helping American workers, small businesses and industries grappling with the economic disruption. Pelosi called on all Americans to take care of themselves amidst the ongoing crisis.  ""Take care, wash your hands, hydrate, and as I always say, you can never dance too much, especially when you're home,"" she said.  "
Former Rep. Chris Collins' prison term delayed due to coronavirus,"New York (CNN)A federal judge on Thursday granted former New York Rep. Chris Collins's request to delay the start of his prison sentence for securities fraud by two months after Collins cited concerns about the coronavirus pandemic and its threat to inmates. Collins, a Western New York Republican who had been scheduled to report to prison for a 26-month sentence on April 21, is now set to begin his sentence June 23. Collins's request came as many inmates and those facing prison sentences have asked to be released from confinement or to delay their sentences out of fear that incarceration creates particularly ripe conditions for the rapid spread of the virus. Those requests have yielded mixed results. Attorneys for the 69-year-old former congressman, who pleaded guilty in October 2019 to one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud and one count of making a false statement, had told the court they believe he is in a high-risk category to contract the virus, due to his age and ""additional"" factors. ""It would be particularly dangerous for an elderly person with underlying health conditions like Mr. Collins to report for incarceration right now in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic that is ravaging the United States,"" his lawyers wrote to US District Court Judge Vernon Broderick. The Manhattan US Attorney's office, which prosecuted Collins, didn't oppose his request to delay the start of his sentence, according to his lawyers. Collins, the first sitting congressman to back President Donald Trump's bid for the White House, resigned from Congress ahead of his guilty plea, after having spent more than a year saying the allegations against him were ""meritless"" and winning reelection while under indictment.

A healthy 39-year-old DJ died of coronavirus. What his young widow and daughter want you to know," (CNN)Nicole Buchanan wasn't even allowed to say goodbye to her husband.  Three weeks ago, Conrad Buchanan was a healthy, vivacious Florida DJ who loved dancing with his daughter. But on March 14, the 39-year-old started feeling sick. His wife Nicole tried to get him tested for coronavirus, but was denied.  ""We couldn't get him tested. I fought and fought and fought,"" she said.  ""They didn't want to test him due to his age and (because) he had no underlying health issues."" By March 22, Conrad's condition had deteriorated so badly that Nicole drove him to the hospital. The young father was intubated immediately after he was dropped off. Nicole went to park the car. She never saw her husband again.  ""I walked up to the doors. The hospital's on lockdown. They wouldn't let anybody in after that,"" she said. ""I never got to say, 'I love you.'"" Conrad Buchanan's death illustrates the harsh reality of Covid-19: No one is immune from this disease, and even young, healthy people can die from it.  ""I need everybody to know that this is serious. People think that it's just going to affect people with underlying health issues, old people. But it doesn't,"" his widow said, weeping.  ""And seeing what my husband had to go through was horrible. And now our life has turned into this horrible nightmare.""  Nicole, too, has tested positive for coronavirus. She said her symptoms are not severe, but she has lost her senses of taste and smell.  The couple's daughter, Skye, is waiting for her test results. She said the loss of her dad is catastrophic. ""We just overall shared everything,"" Skye said. ""He brought me to school, he brought me to ballet. He was my everything."" Skye said she misses her dad's valiant attempts at dancing. Conrad performed with Skye during a father-daughter day at Skye's ballet school, though he dropped her during a lift. ""It was funny because he could perform in front of like millions of people when he DJ'd, but (when) he danced ... it wasn't the best,"" Skye said with a laugh.  Now, Skye is left with just memories of her dad -- and an important lesson he taught her:  ""Find your rhythm in life. Listen to the beat. Dance and express yourself in order to connect with people from all walks of life,"" she said.  A GoFundMe account has been established to help the family.  Nicole Buchanan said she wants everyone to stay home and take precautions so no one else has to suffer what her family has endured.   ""You guys have to take this seriously,"" she said. ""I would hate for anybody -- anyone else's family or children -- to have to go through what we've gone through. Our hospital systems aren't ready. Just stay home."" "
Small business owners like me need more than the government is giving us,"Alex Dabagh is the owner of Pietro Handbags in New York City. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.Our family operates two large factories on the island of Manhattan -- about 10,000 square feet of leather goods manufacturing. We employ 40 well-paid artisans. Like millions of small businesses across the country, the coronavirus, and its effect on the economy, has devastated us. We're doing everything possible to keep the lights on, and to support our fellow New Yorkers during this crisis. But we can't do it alone. We need more help from the government, including grants large enough to help us pay our bills and enabling us to explore ways to let our factory be part of the fight against the virus.   For 38 years, we have been manufacturing handbags, belts and other accessories using imported Italian leather. We also supply leather goods for just about every designer boutique in New York City. My dad started the business after emigrating from Lebanon with $400 in his pocket. We're a classic American success story, but right now our survival, and the livelihoods of our 40 employees, is in serious jeopardy.  Although handbags are not essential during a pandemic, our machinery and industrial capacity should not lay dormant. Our factories can be converted in a matter of days to produce thousands of protective masks and gowns for health care workers every day. We have already sourced three-ply polypropylene non-woven fabric for masks and polyethylene plastic for gowns. The masks we produce will not match the FDA safety standards of N95 masks, but N95 masks are in very short supply. The polyethylene gowns may meet FDA standards, but we need guidance to be certain. If the hospitals will buy our masks, our employees can return to work and join the fight against coronavirus. I'm not doing this to make a profit -- I just want to help by putting our machines and our people to use. We will, of course, stagger our employees' hours and create separation on the manufacturing floor to ensure our employees are safe. I have reached out to the city and state and hope to hear back from them soon.  Meanwhile, I'm also looking at every resource, government grant and loan program. The emergency $10,000 grant in the federal stimulus package is nice, but already my small business is losing $20,000 each day.  I am also going to apply to the long-term forgivable loan program, but the fine print in the terms and conditions -- which has not been finalized -- will make or break this program. These long-term, low-interest loans could help us survive, but without clear rules on how these loans may be forgiven and without assurance that they cannot be changed by a future Congress, they could become an economic burden that could put us out of business in the future. The Connected Commerce Council, a nonprofit trade organization, has been keeping a comprehensive list of other emergency funding and assistance options, but I am worried these too won't be enough. We need grants that will help cover rent, payroll and health insurance. Grants mean life for a small business; loans mean a slow, miserable death. Our company lost half of our employees after 9/11, but bounced back to open a second factory in 2012. We also survived the 2008 recession without any help from the government. The difference now is that we are deemed nonessential, so we have to temporarily close. We are going to fight every single day through this crisis. But we need the government, including the Food and Drug Administration, to help us get certified and guide us to manufacture masks and protective gear and provide us with the grants we need to weather this storm. To paraphrase New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, we will fight and win, because we are New Yorkers. I'm proud to be here, to carry on my father's legacy and fight this virus alongside my neighbors. "
Kenya has freed nearly 5000 inmates via newly adopted Skype court sessions," (CNN)Kenya is decongesting its prisons to prevent overcrowding as a way to curtail the spread of coronavirus in the country.

She delivered 5 Judgements and 8 rulings. 21 remandees were released. pic.twitter.com/Jj6FOQAOup In the past month, the East African country has released 4800 prisoners in different parts of the country, according to Anne Amadi, the chief registrar of the judiciary in Kenya.  Many of the sessions leading to the release of these prisoners were held virtually through Skype and Zoom, she said. ""We prioritized getting a lot of people out of prison, especially petty offenders. Those who are in prison for a short term and those who have been there for a long time but have just about six months and below to go,"" she told CNN. ""As of Friday last week, we managed to decongest the prison by about 4800 inmates from different parts of the country. All our 39 high court stations have released people. Most of them, a good number, through Skype or Zoom,"" she added. Dusk to dawn curfews Kenya currently has 110 cases of coronavirus as of Thursday. Kenya's President, Uhuru Kenyatta also declared a dusk to dawn curfew on March 27, restricting movement in the country from 7 p.m to 5 a.m in a bid to limit its spread.  In Mombasa high court, Kenyan Judge, Eric Ogola delivered 23 judgments in his chambers through Skype on March 30. According to a message posted on Twitter by the Kenya Judiciary, Ogola was on video calls with suspects at the Shimo la Tewa prison. The suspects took turns appearing on camera, as he read out his verdict.  ""Today, Mombasa High Court Presiding Judge, Hon. Eric Ogola, delivered 23 judgments through the use of Skype Conference to the inmates in Shimo La Tewa Prison,"" read the tweet.  These measures are being implemented in line with a directive by the Kenyan government which has discouraged large gatherings of any form.  Law courts in Malindi, southeastern Kenya also held sessions on March 23 via Skype's video conferencing session, according to local media. In Taita Taveta, one of the country's counties, Voi High court Judge, Farah Amin processed 24 cases on Skype and issued orders for the release of 23 petty offenders from Wundanyi prison.   Kenya confirmed its first case of coronavirus March 12 and since then has suspended all sporting events, open-air religious meetings and all major events.  Amadi says when the first case of the virus was confirmed in the country, the National Council on the Administration of Justice (NCAJ) held a meeting where workers within the judiciary were advised to deal with only urgent cases and work from home.  The NCAJ is a national council that brings together all the actors in the justice sector.  ""We agreed that we needed to generally downscale operations and work with minimal staff in each station... We realize that courts are one of the riskiest places to spread the virus because we deal with so many people and we have so many files handled there by so many people,"" she said.  "
"DoD working to get 100,000 body bags in anticipation of increasing coronavirus deaths"," (CNN)As fatalities climb from the spread of coronavirus, the Department of Defense has moved to procure 100,000 body bags to accommodate increased demand from morgues across the country.CNN's Kevin Liptak and Kaitlan Collins contributed to this report. ""The Department of Defense and the Defense Logistics Agency have a longstanding arrangement with FEMA to procure key commodities from DLA's industrial partners during crisis response operations,"" Defense Department spokesman Lt. Col Mike Andrews announced in a release Thursday. ""DLA is currently responding to FEMA's prudent planning efforts for 100,000 pouches to address mortuary contingencies on behalf of state health agencies."" A defense official told CNN Thursday that the department already has roughly half the number of pouches on hand as part of its existing inventory and hopes to ship an initial 15,000 pouches in the coming days. The remaining 50,000 pouches will be acquired from existing suppliers, per the official. During a White House briefing on Tuesday, President Donald Trump spoke of a ""painful"" and ""tough"" two-week stretch as his task force warned of the potential for between 100,000 and 240,000 deaths even if federal guidelines are followed precisely. Earlier this week, the Federal Emergency Management Agency told CNN it had already moved to address a looming surge in fatalities related to coronavirus, including launching plans for a second disaster relief morgue in New York City and activating a Disaster Mortuary Operational Response Team to assist the New York Office of Chief Medical Examiner with fatality management and mortuary affairs. In a statement, FEMA told CNN Tuesday, ""FEMA is aware of many states' planning efforts to account for mortuary contingencies and has increased its posture to support these requests once received from the states. Prudent planning for these future conditions is taken very seriously by FEMA, and we are working with Regional and State health and emergency managers to ramp up available assets to meet contingency needs for the most affected areas."" Locally, officials and industry professionals prepare for rising death tolls On the state and local level, medical examiners have also quietly begun preparing for a surge in fatalities.  In New York, where deaths so far have dwarfed those of any other state, officials with the New York City Office of the Chief Medical Examiner have deployed 45 refrigerated trucks outside hospitals city wide, which -- in concert with an additional 85 refrigerated trucks requested from FEMA -- will be used to store the deceased while awaiting transport to funeral homes and interment.  New Jersey has also deployed additional refrigeration units across the northern, central and southern parts of the state to prevent morgue overflow, while the District of Columbia's Office of the Chief Medical Examiner pointed to ongoing discussions with FEMA about expanded morgue facilities in the event of increased traffic. But a dramatic surge in deaths would also put strain on the preparation and interment of bodies, as funeral directors, cemeteries and crematoriums scramble to keep pace with an exponentially rising death toll. In most states, funeral directors are the only party licensed and authorized to oversee the transfer of human remains from a hospital morgue to the funeral home, and ultimately, the decedent's final resting place. That means limited storage and turnover at any given funeral home could cause a backlog of bodies at a hospital morgue. ""If you imagine just your business volume increasing by one-and-a-half to twice its daily normal output, there's obviously a strain there, just due to the volume itself and the strain really comes in terms of just ensuring that you are able to, to properly care for the decedent,"" Michael Lanotte, executive director and CEO of the New York Funeral Directors Association, told CNN on Monday. Still, Lanotte said, ""Funeral directors have reported to us that they have not had slowdowns in their ability to help families who have lost a loved one. There are still, you know, the normal procedures taking place."" Risk of coronavirus transmission has drastically altered the mourning and burial process too, according to Jimmy Olson, who heads the National Chapter of the Funeral Directors Association. Olson told CNN that member funeral homes have had to limit services to nine attendees to maintain social distancing and have begun offering streamed funeral services for additional guests, while families with cremated remains are scheduling funerals as far off as September. ""How do you start a grieving process when you don't have a funeral?"" he said. And then there's the issue of interment. As New York's number of Covid-19-related deaths climbed into the thousands, Lanotte told CNN that ordinances restricting the hours of operation for crematoriums and cemeteries could form another bottleneck in moving remains out of the hospital system and into the ground. A couple crematoriums in the city, he said, have ""been provided temporary permits to operate additional hours to try to keep up with the additional volume.""  ""The process takes a certain amount of time,"" Lanotte said. ""And we know, like I said, the division of cemeteries, those cemeteries that work under them, they are working in shifts to maintain normal operation."" Still the lag time between the surge in coronavirus cases and the subsequent rise in fatalities allowed morgues, funeral homes and cemeteries extra lead time to prepare, unlike hospital systems across the country, which were kneecapped early on by shortages in personal protective equipment and limited federal guidance on how to curb transmission.  Olson told CNN last week that emergency management departments had already met with local funeral directors, allowing time to review inventory, increase purchases and take stock of storage capacities before being overwhelmed by a grim workload.  ""These things are happening quietly,"" Olson said. ""People don't know about it. But we are preparing for it."" This story has been updated with additional reporting Thursday. "
"For the deaf or hard of hearing, face masks pose new challenge","Laken Brooks is a current graduate student at the University of Florida where she studies disability, digital humanities, public history, and literature. She has written for the National Trust for Historic Preservation, the Digital Literature Review, and the National Park Service. Follow her on Twitter at @lakenbrooks222. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely her own. View more opinion articles on CNN. (CNN)I'd been social distancing for a week and a half when I ventured into the nearest grocery store. As I surveyed the shelves, an employee caught my attention. ""He's asking me a question,"" I thought. But I couldn't understand him.Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook He, like many of the employers and the shoppers in the store, wore a face mask. And this worker is not alone. Dr. Anthony Fauci and other federal health officials are seriously considering the possibility that, should resources allow, most Americans should wear face masks to slow the spread of Covid-19. But when people wear masks, I feel like I'm wearing earmuffs. I was finally around people again in the grocery store, even if it was from a safe distance. But in a world without voices, I felt more isolated than ever before.   Some people, like me, read lips. I have tinnitus: ringing in my ears. While I can hear clearly most of the time, this sound distortion comes and goes, and it's unpredictable. I feel a reverberating pain in my ears when I hear a sound that is too low or too high of a pitch. Reading lips has helped me cope with this auditory disorder for five years. Covid-19 changed everything. Face masks have become the must-have health item for 2020. Two images have become iconic on our screens during this pandemic: empty streets and people covering their noses and mouths. For many deaf people or people like me with less severe hearing problems, the two images convey the same loneliness.  While masks are a vital health care tool for many people, they also present a new set of challenges for the deaf community. When people wear masks, including trending DIY masks, they muffle their voices and prevent people from reading their lips. For people who are hard of hearing, that's a problem. I took to social media to see how Covid-19 is impacting people in the real world. Non-deaf medical professionals and deaf people alike have experienced unexpected communication issues during Covid-19. These problems range from my inconveniences when shopping to potentially life-threatening medical misunderstandings. Lauren Sugrue was born hard of hearing. Sugrue says, ""Lip reading has been more difficult because you don't want people to take off their masks or other face coverings for protection. But when you can't see their lips, it's extremely difficult to know what they're saying. I've had to find new ways to communicate even before Covid-19, but the pandemic has thrown new hurdles in our way."" Sugrue effectively used a whiteboard to communicate with doctors before coronavirus began to spread; however, many people in the deaf community now cannot pass a piece of paper or a whiteboard back and forth to a person who is standing six feet away. Deva Darnell, a non-deaf nurse in an emergency room, says ""I have a hard time communicating with my patients. People who could normally read my lips now can't understand me."" Darnell can't take off her mask when she works. Even if she could, her patients with vision impairments can't read her lips if she stands far away. ""I feel guilty, like I can't serve some of my patients as well or as quickly as I need to."" We are three people. But our stories represent thousands, if not millions, of people around the globe who are struggling to connect with others during Covid-19. The Deaf/Hard of Hearing Technology Rehabilitation Engineering Research Center published strategies for deaf people to use when they navigate public or medical spaces, such as by downloading speech-to-text apps or preparing a written script before leaving their home. The organization states, ""You need to be prepared. Before the pandemic, hospitals had good services to help you communicate clearly. There are new rules now. Many hospitals will not allow in-person interpreters to go in with you."" But this burden shouldn't fall solely on the shoulders of the deaf community. In these unprecedented times, we will have to work together to find unprecedented ways to communicate. For me and others like me, there is no easy solution to this problem, so we should consider many different tools to make communicating as easy as possible. Sign language is perhaps the most obvious method to make spaces more accessible to the deaf community. Sugrue recommends that essential businesses hire at least one sign language interpreter and provide whiteboards that ""can be sprayed down with disinfectant."" Other deaf individuals may benefit from video chats in which they can read a person's lips on the screen while maintaining a safe distance. A whopping 15% of American adults report hearing loss, but many people never learn to sign because they lose their hearing gradually. Some of these people -- like my grandmother and perhaps yours, too -- rely on lip-reading. To help these individuals who are not fluent in ASL, but still have some hearing, essential workers may carry portable microphones that clip onto a headset or a belt.  Nurses and doctors may want to experiment with phone apps that turn a smartphone into a microphone when you pair your phone with any Bluetooth speaker. These simple adjustments will boost their volume and bridge the communication gap. Another possible solution are face masks with a plastic panel over the mouth, like this one. This see-through prototype has not been medically tested, and people who wear such a mask will need to be careful that the heat and moisture from their breath do not fog up the clear panel. However, this design is a step forward in the right direction as citizens all over the country experiment with new options to make communicating easier for all of us. Much is uncertain about Covid-19 at this time, including how deaf and non-deaf people will continue speaking with one another during the months to come. What I know for sure is that we can choose to emerge from this pandemic with a greater understanding of each other and new ways to stay connected, even when we can't hear every word.   "
"For Vladimir Putin, coronavirus offers a diplomatic opening and outsized PR dividends"," (CNN)Russian President Vladimir Putin knows how to make a very small investment for an outsized public-relations gain, and the Covid-19 pandemic has been no exception.CNN's Matthew Chance contributed to this article On Wednesday, a Russian An-124 cargo plane landed at New York's John F. Kennedy Airport carrying a shipment of medical supplies, including ventilators and personal protective equipment, to help US hospitals and communities on the front lines of the fight with coronavirus. It was a from-Russia-with-love moment: The New York air traffic controller thanked the Russian pilot when the massive aircraft landed, and Dmitry Polyanskiy, Russia's First Deputy Permanent Representative to the United Nations, tweeted that the shipment was a ""gesture of solidarity with New Yorkers who are in a very difficult situation at the moment."" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that the Russian side offered Washington assistance in light of the epidemiological situation in the US, Russian state news agency RIA-Novosti reported Tuesday. ""Trump gratefully accepted this humanitarian aid,"" Peskov said, according to RIA. At first, it seemed like a typically Putinesque masterstroke of public relations: Russia, once a recipient of US aid after the collapse of the Soviet Union, was now coming to the aid of the world's wealthiest nation. But in a statement, US State Department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus emphasized that the shipment was a purchase, not a donation.  ""As a follow-up to the March 30 phone call between President Trump and President Putin, the United States has agreed to purchase needed medical supplies, including ventilators and personal protection equipment, from Russia, which were handed over to FEMA on April 1 in New York City"" she said. The Kremlin, nonetheless, cast the delivery as a humanitarian act. Russia's Foreign Ministry said Thursday that half of the aid sent to the US against the coronavirus was paid for by American taxpayers, and half by Russian Direct Investment Fund, Russia's sovereign wealth fund. On the same day the Russian cargo plane landed in New York, the Russian military -- which has tightly scripted the public information around its mission -- released footage of its doctors and chemical/biological/radiological specialists working to sanitize Italian senior care centers using mobile spray disinfection stations and decontamination equipment. They were part of a military mission dispatched earlier by the Russian Ministry of Defense, which sent nine Il-76 aircraft with teams of virologists and epidemiologists to help Italy in its response to the pandemic. So what, exactly, was Putin's calculation in sending aid abroad, precisely at a moment when coronavirus cases seem to be ramping up in Russia itself? Russia officially has 3,548 confirmed cases of coronavirus, according to the country's monitoring headquarters. That's a relatively low figure, compared with China or the United States. But Russian authorities have signaled that they expect the situation to worsen: Russians are currently under an enforced regime of self-isolation, and Putin signed a law this week that increases penalties for violating quarantine rules. Authorities in Moscow have said they are preparing to roll out a digital enforcement tool that will use QR codes and a smartphone app to enforce the lockdown in the capital. The delivery of much-needed equipment to the US, then, has come in for some criticism in Russia, where reports of protective equipment shortages have caused concern. The Alliance of Doctors, a professional advocacy group, criticized the fanfare around the US shipment. ""Well, great,"" the organization said in a statement. ""We collect money all over the country to buy remedies for doctors, and our authorities sell personal protective equipment in the United States. Pure mockery."" In a conference call with reporters Thursday, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov defended Russia's actions. ""There is always criticism of this nature, but at the same time international cooperation in fighting coronavirus is a very important measure of activities of any country,"" Peskov said. ""No country can effectively fight the virus alone without international cooperation."" Leave aside for a moment the controversy in Russia around the shipment: Internationally, it's a relatively inexpensive way for Putin to build goodwill with President Donald Trump. Russia, after all, remains under US and European sanction over the 2014 annexation of Crimea, and relations between Moscow and Washington are abysmal. For both a Russian and international audience, then, the aid shipments send a powerful visual signal: Putin, once again, is playing the decisive man of action.   "

Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker tweeted a photo of the plane being loaded with the personal protective equipment that he said would go to the state's health care workers on the front lines of the coronavirus crisis. According to a source, Baker is extremely frustrated that the federal government outbid him on supplies that were en route to Massachusetts. He worked with New England Patriots' owner Robert Kraft and the Patriots to get these supplies brought over from China. ""No days off. Thanks to some serious teamwork, Massachusetts is set to receive over 1 million N95 masks for our front-line workers. Huge thanks to the Krafts and several dedicated partners for making this happen,"" Baker said in the tweet. Robert Kraft and Patriots president Jonathan Kraft partnered with the state to purchase 1.4 million N95 masks for Massachusetts, according to the team. Robert Kraft also purchased another 300,000 protective masks for New York state. ""It is an honor for our family to be a part of this humanitarian mission. We knew that purchasing greatly-needed N95 masks and providing the Patriots plane to expedite their delivery to local hospitals would immediately help protect our courageous healthcare professionals,"" Robert Kraft said in a statement provided by the Patriots. The plane landed at Boston's Logan International Airport at 5:55 p.m. ET carrying 1.2 million masks. A second shipment of another half-million N95 masks is scheduled to arrive as early as next week. After landing, the masks were lowered off the plane and placed on luggage trolleys, according to video from CNN affiliate WBZ. From there, the masks were hauled into the airport's Delta hangar where they were received by the National Guard. ""The Krafts, our partners Ambassador Huang Ping, Dr. Jason Li, Gene Hartigan and our Covid-19 Command Center personnel teamed up to get this job done and we eagerly await the plane landing at Logan Airport soon,"" Baker said in a statement provided to CNN. ""Our administration will keep pursuing the PPE necessary to support our brave front-line workers who are working tirelessly to save lives during this pandemic."" As of Thursday morning, Massachusetts has 7,738 reported cases of coronavirus and 122 people have died, according to figures from Johns Hopkins University.  Baker has issued an emergency order requiring all Massachusetts businesses and organizations that do not provide essential services to close their physical workplaces to help slow the spread of coronavirus. These businesses are encouraged to continue their operations remotely. The order also limits public gatherings. "
Former NBA star Stephon Marbury to help bring masks to New York," (CNN)For NBA veteran Stephon Marbury, the coronavirus pandemic has hit close to a couple of places he calls home.  The first is New York, more specifically the neighborhood of Brooklyn where Marbury grew up.  He was well known in the district when freelance writer Darcy Frey wrote a book called ""The Last Shot"" about Stephon and his high school teammates.  The second is Beijing, China, where the 43-year-old is coaching the Beijing Royal Fighters of the Chinese Basketball Association. That's why the two-time NBA All-Star is working with a company in China to sell 10 million masks to his hometown at cost instead of a profit. ""The Brooklyn borough president, he asked me to help him and I just came to bat for him,"" Marbury told CNN's Anderson Cooper.  Eric Adams, the president, tweeted in response: ""Thank you Stephon Marbury for stepping up to offer the greatest assist of your life. You are a true friend to this city."" READ: The NBA could lose billions. Who will eat that loss? READ: Why Enes Kanter has more than just losing NBA season on his mind 'Stay at home'   After leaving the NBA in 2009, Marbury joined the Chinese Basketball Association, and eventually became a three-time CBA champion. Marbury has a lot of fans in China, as evidenced by the ""House of Marbury Museum"" dedicated to him in 2015.  Despite his popularity, Marbury downplayed his role in helping to secure the facemasks.  ""We had some people that knew people in the factories that made masks, and the opportunity presented itself for us to be able to help,"" he said.  Marbury faced one more reason to join the fight against Covid-19, as a cousin of his passed away from the disease. That's one reason why he wants to help spread the message about how to combat the virus. ""That's the only way to really stop it - to stay at home,"" he insists.  In fact, Marbury is hoping his home state takes note of his new place of residence. ""People were looking at me strange for having a mask on when I got here (to New York). You see so many people having large gatherings - still. That wasn't going on in China during this time."" Those familiar with Marbury won't be surprised by his actions and message. Though known for his hot temper as a player, Marbury had a soft spot that included helping to develop an affordable basketball sneaker for any impoverished youth who couldn't afford a more expensive pair.  A former teammate on the Beijing Ducks told CNN in 2012: ""He brings the whole team a positive and fighting spirit."" Now Marbury is hoping to take that fighting spirit to Covid-19.  "
the Point: How 2 Trump-loving governors are struggling amid the coronavirus crisis," (CNN)On Wednesday, Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp issued a shelter-in-place order for his state. THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! In each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! Asked why he had made the decision, Kemp said this (bolding mine):  ""Finding out that this virus is now transmitting before people see signs, so what we've been telling people from directives from the CDC for weeks now that if you start feeling bad, stay home... those individuals could've been infecting people before they ever felt bad. But we didn't know that until the last 24 hours."" Which is, well, crazy. Because asymptomatic transmission of coronavirus -- people without symptoms able to pass the virus to others -- is something that people following this closely have known for, at least, weeks. (There are questions about how many people get the virus via asymptomatic transmission versus how many people get it from people showing symptoms.) Kemp's decision to shut down the state -- and his unsettlingly late realization of a known fact about the virus -- came on the same day that his neighbor to the south -- Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis -- also issued a shelter-in-place directive for his state.  DeSantis had faced heavy criticism for weeks for his unwillingness to take more charge of the situation; he deferred to local officials to make decisions about closures -- which led to, among other things, scenes of spring breakers partying on Florida's beaches even as the virus was beginning to rage across the country. So, what changed DeSantis' mind? ""When you see the President up there and his demeanor the last couple of days, that's not necessarily how he always is,"" explained DeSantis on Wednesday.  Yes, really. The governor of Florida -- a massively populated state with a huge elderly population -- decided to, finally, issue a shelter-in-place order because he saw the President's ""demeanor"" had changed this week. (Presumably, DeSantis watched Trump's coronavirus press conference on Tuesday, when the President acknowledged the long-known reality that the death toll from coronavirus in the US was likely to be over 100,000.) Kemp and DeSantis -- and their decidedly questionable reasons for finally shutting down their states amid the coronavirus pandemic -- are prime examples of what unquestioning adherence to the President produces, particularly when the President has been, until very recently, a fount of misinformation and underplaying of the threat posed by coronavirus. ""The fact that so many GOP big state governors -- in TX, FL & GA -- all tightened statewide restrictions immediately after Trump finally let his advisers frame the full risk from the WH podium underscores how much his earlier minimizing contributed to the critical delays in those states,"" tweeted Ron Brownstein, a senior editor at The Atlantic and a CNN contributor. (On Thursday morning, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott joined DeSantis and Kemp as his shelter-in-place order went into effect.) Both DeSantis and Kemp ran for governor in 2018 as Trump acolytes, securing endorsements from the President in competitive intraparty races. During the primary campaign, DeSantis ran an ad in which he told his young daughter to ""build that wall!"" (she was playing with toy blocks) and read Trump's ""The Art of the Deal"" to his infant son. In the wake of his runoff victory, Kemp pledged to ""unapologetically stand with President Trump to secure our border, deport criminal aliens, crush gangs and ensure a bright and promising future for our families."" And, in the general election, Trump campaigned for both men in the final days of the 2018 midterms -- helping to deliver them both very narrow wins. Kemp won by 1.4 percentage points over Stacey Abrams; DeSantis beat Andrew Gillum by .4 percent of the vote. It's not an exaggeration then to say that Kemp and DeSantis owe their political careers -- or at least their governorships -- to Trump.  Which means they aren't going to so much as cross the street without checking in with him first. And they certainly aren't going to break with the President on an issue freighted with as much import as the national response to coronavirus. Depending on a president -- any president -- as the sole arbiter of the right thing to do in a situation as fluid and dangerous as the fight against coronavirus is a mistake. Depending on this President, with his long record of exaggerations and misstatements -- on coronavirus and, well, everything else too -- as your primary source of information on the best way to battle this virus is deeply dangerous. And borderline incompetent. "
DeSantis risked the lives of Floridians,"Errol Louis is the host of ""Inside City Hall,"" a nightly political show on NY1, a New York all-news channel. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN. (CNN)A handful of governors deserve top marks for moving swiftly and efficiently to implement social distancing, issue stay-at-home orders and prepare to do battle against the coronavirus. Govs. Jay Inslee of Washington, Andrew Cuomo of New York, Mike DeWine of Ohio and Gavin Newsom of California are among them: they were early, effective and well-organized. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, by contrast, has been late and lackadaisical, in ways that will undoubtedly cost many Floridians their health -- and, perhaps, their lives. Despite surging numbers of fatalities in New York and Washington and a rising tide of Florida editorial boards demanding action, DeSantis did not issue a statewide stay-at-home order until April 1. That made Florida the last state with more than 5,000 coronavirus cases to implement a statewide shutdown. ""Unlike some other governors, DeSantis ignored the obvious for too long, and Floridians likely are sicker for it,"" the Miami Herald said in a scathing editorial. ""His statewide essential-services-only order, though welcome, is indeed, too late."" On March 22, the same editorial board has issued another action under the pointed headline: ""Coronavirus is killing us in Florida, Gov. DeSantis. Act like you give a damn."" DeSantis drew widespread condemnation for resisting calls to close Florida's beaches to throngs of students partying for Spring Break. The governor finally relented, but not before thousands of kids gathered -- and then fanned out to homes and college campuses all over the nation, which likely helped spread the virus far and wide.    As far back as March 18, the Orlando Sun-Sentinel editorial board noted: ""When governors in other states are more aggressive, it makes you wonder: What do they know that we don't? Why are they more aggressive than we are, when Florida has more cases than they do?"" The answer appears to be political: DeSantis is a close ally of President Donald Trump, who recently changed his official residence from New York to Florida. And until now, it seems DeSantis was following along with Trump's strategy of trying to minimize the danger and prevalence of the virus.  As the Palm Beach Post editorial board put it: ""There's no denying it: DeSantis, like some -- but not other, more-conscientious -- Republican governors, is taking his marching orders from President Trump, who is still downplaying the intensity of COVID-19′s grip on the nation, ignoring medical experts and playing politics with Americans' very lives.""  That's not an exaggeration. Florida is tied with Maine as the state with the largest share of population (21%) that is 65 years or older. The millions of seniors in the state -- many in retirement communities and nursing homes -- are especially vulnerable to coronavirus. DeSantis' long-delayed decision to issue a stay-home order put them at greater risk. He has company in the slow-to-act governor's club.  Gov. Bill Lee of Tennessee is resisting calls from the state's medical professional societies to issue a mandatory stay-at-home order. Mississippi's Tate Reeves sparked confusion by issuing an executive order that overruled efforts by local counties and cities to implement their own stay-at-home rules (Reeves finally relented and issued a statewide ban on gatherings of 10 or more).  In Arizona, Gov. Doug Ducey's director of emergency management resigned, citing ""lack of communication and transparency"" as the state geared up to implement stay-at-home orders.  And Texas Gov. Greg Abbott wasted valuable time by not ramping up testing and insisting that local cities, not the state, should lead the response to the virus.  President Trump and other leaders liken the fight against coronavirus to a war. If so, DeSantis and other field commanders should be demoted or court-martialed for dawdling as the invisible enemy gathered strength and began wreaking havoc in our homeland.    "
FDA authorizes first coronavirus antibody test," (CNN)The US Food and Drug Administration has issued its first emergency use authorization for a coronavirus test that looks for antibodies in the blood.Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.   That type of test, called a serology test, would be able to identify past coronavirus infections, although it may be less effective at identifying recent ones.   The authorized test, from a manufacturer called Cellex Inc., requires blood to be collected through a vein, and the test itself can only be performed in a certified lab.   Because antibodies can take time to develop, the FDA has previously warned against using antibody tests to definitively diagnose coronavirus.   But in issuing what is known as an Emergency Use Authorization for the new test, the FDA signaled that the benefits of using the new blood test outweighed the risks.   ""Based on the totality of scientific evidence available to FDA, it is reasonable to believe that your product may be effective in diagnosing COVID-19,"" said the agency, adding that ""the known and potential benefits of your product when used for diagnosing COVID-19, outweigh the known and potential risks of your product.""   Unlike most coronavirus tests, which generally require a swab and look for signs of the virus itself, antibody tests look instead for our body's response to a virus.   The FDA said in its letter that initial antibodies against coronavirus are ""generally detectable in blood several days after initial infection,"" but the agency cautioned that ""levels over the course of infection are not well characterized.""   The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says it is also working to develop a serology test -- or blood test -- that could look for antibodies, which would develop even in people with mild or no symptoms.   Such tests can allow officials to better understand how prevalent coronavirus infections truly are, because they can identify people who had been previously infected but showed little or no symptoms.   On Tuesday, a company called Bodysphere falsely claimed that an FDA Emergency Use Authorization was issued for an antibody test that could detect coronavirus in two minutes from a pinprick of blood.   Multiple news outlets reported on the announcement, but later retracted their articles after the FDA confirmed that no such test had been authorized at the time. On Wednesday, the company acknowledged that the test had not in fact received the authorization.   FDA guidance issued last month allows antibody tests to be manufactured and distributed without such authorizations. But any explicit authorization from the FDA -- such as the one issued to Cellex -- is a sign that regulators have confidence in a test's validation data and believe its benefits outweigh its risks.

Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, videos and features He started by providing food and drugs to elderly people in Parma before being drafted in as a volunteer ambulance driver, working up to 12 hours a day moving Covid-19 patients between the city's three hospitals. ""I was (back home) in Parma, no training, no matches, no games at the weekend. They had completely stopped,"" Mbanda tells CNN Sport. ""I asked myself, what can I do for my community here in Parma? I did research on the web and found an article that talked about collaboration between the Parma Community and the Yellow Cross. ""The idea was to transfer patients from a busy hospital to one that is free. But actually, it's impossible to say that a hospital bed is free because every time a bed is freed, it's filled by someone in the waiting room because there is such a long queue."" Last week Mbanda left a hospital with a queue of 150 people waiting for beds and treatment. He estimates that 95% of treatment space in Parma's hospitals has been converted into coronavirus wards.

At school I studied World War I, World War II, the Iraq war, Syria, Africa -- but this is in totally another world, against an invisible enemy. It's unreal. ""My parents, both my father and my mother, raised me to help people when I can -- when I've got money, when I've got energy to help them, if people are in trouble, or if there is an emergency."" Mbanda's father is a surgeon, and despite his dad's efforts to convince him to become a doctor when he was a teenager, the backrow forward says this is his first time working with the emergency services.  ""Every day there is a different hospital that is the busiest, so maybe one day you transfer patients from one hospital to another, and the following day you transfer another patient from the last hospital to the first one,"" he adds. ""We have to find a balance to let doctors and nurses work where possible without stress and without too many people to treat. We have to balance it.""

""I have to train to keep in shape because I hope as soon as possible we can go back on the pitch to play rugby."" In the meantime, he wants to convince as many Italians as possible to think about ways they can help vulnerable people in the country.  ""For young people who live alone without kids or without elderly relatives -- if they are bored at home and the only thing they're doing now is complaining on social media, try and research on the web, or make a 30-minute call to an elderly person who is home alone,"" says Mbanda.

Eduardo Moreno, 44, told law enforcement investigators he was ""suspicious"" of the ship and believed it ""had an alternate purpose related to COVID-19 or a government takeover,"" the Justice Department said in a news release, citing the affidavit.  Moreno has been charged with one count of train wrecking, the Justice Department said.  The federal public defender's office in Los Angeles, which is representing Moreno, declined to comment on the case.  According to the Justice Department, Moreno, a train engineer at the Port of Los Angeles, crashed the train at the end of the tracks, running through barriers before it came to a rest more than 250 yards away from the ship. No one was injured, the news release said, and the ship was not damaged.  The crash was witnessed by a California Highway Patrol officer, who took Moreno into custody as he tried to flee the scene, the news release added. According to the affidavit obtained by CNN, Moreno confessed to crashing the train in interviews with both the Los Angeles Port Police and the FBI.  Moreno said he derailed the train because it would bring media attention, the affidavit said, and he hoped to ""wake people up.""  The affidavit also detailed videos taken from inside the train. In one, Moreno ignites a road flare inside the train, the affidavit said. He then ""put the train in full speed and held his hand toward the camera with his middle finger raised.""  ""I don't know. Sometimes you just get a little snap and man, it was fricking exciting... I just had it and I was committed,"" Moreno told police, according to the affidavit. ""I just went for it, I had one chance."" "
'Complete waste of time.' UK media slam government coronavirus briefings,"London (CNN Business)Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government can typically find a safe space in the digital and print editions of many of the most popular British newspapers. But some of the UK government's biggest cheerleaders are now tearing into it over its response to the coronavirus pandemic, slamming confusing and conflicting messaging from senior members of Johnson's cabinet.   In the crosshairs: The government's daily press conferences and the lack of a clearly articulated plan for boosting coronavirus testing capabilities. Only 2,000 frontline health care workers have so far been tested. While the daily Downing Street briefings were initially conducted with reporters in person, they've been held virtually for more than a week because of strict social-distancing rules. Reporters have to take part via video chat, making it harder for them to interrupt or challenge government ministers with followup questions.  Most striking is ferocious criticism from The Telegraph, a supporter of the Conservative Party, Johnson's former employer and the one newspaper he could normally rely on to boost his government no matter the situation.  Telegraph political columnist Michael Deacon has turned his fire on the ministers now routinely handling the press conferences since Johnson was forced into self isolation last Friday after he tested positive for coronavirus. Deacon's column on Wednesday called the briefings ""pathetic"" and ""a complete waste of time.""  ""People need clarity and candor. This evening, all they got was 24 minutes of the most pitiful, dispiriting waffle,"" he wrote of the most recent press conference, lead by Business Secretary Alok Sharma. The front page of Thursday's Telegraph was no kinder. Under a banner headline ""Questions without answers"" atop of a photo of Sharma, the Telegraph excoriated the government for being ""unable to answer basic questions"" about increasing testing capabilities.  Citing former health ministers and medical experts calling the government's handling ""ridiculous,"" the paper said the government was releasing scant details on a five-point plan to tackle the testing crisis.  Andrew Neil, chairman of the Spectator, another Conservative-leaning publication, called the press conference on Wednesday ""particularly uninformative,"" with ""far too much waffle and obfuscation."" The Daily Mail, also a Conservative-booster, lambasted the government in its own blaring cover story, saying ""Mail demands ministers FIX TESTING FIASCO NOW.""   ""By a country mile, the greatest misstep of this government in cracking the virus has been the shambles over mass testing,"" the paper's editorial board wrote. ""Mr. Johnson says he is exasperated by the slow progress. Welcome to how the rest of the nation feels!"" Opposition party officials have even taken to citing the Mail, not a typical ally, in a clear sign the government's communication strategy is failing.  Shami Chakrabarti, Labour's top spokesperson on legal affairs, called for the government to be more transparent and clear in its communications. ""What the Daily Mail is now calling the testing scandal or shambles is an example of a lack of both clarity of what the plan is and how it is going to be executed,"" she told BBC radio. "
Professional CrossFit unites in common cause during the coronavirus pandemic," (CNN)As the sport of professional CrossFit sits in limbo, unsure as to whether their annual world championships, the CrossFit Games scheduled for late July, will even take place, many of the sport's biggest stars are coming together, albeit digitally, for a greater cause.  @nobullproject supports the #UnitedinMovement initiative. Repost @nobullproject ""Introducing the United In Movement Trainer. 100% of net proceeds from the United In Movement Black & Pink Trainers will be donated to @unitedinmovement. Available for pre-order 4/3, 8PM ET. #IAMNOBULL #JustTheHorns"" #ForwardTogetherA post shared by  United In Movement (@unitedinmovement) on Apr 1, 2020 at 6:19pm PDT The coronavirus pandemic has forced the vast majority of CrossFit gyms to close their doors, resulting in major financial losses for gym owners.  According to the online CrossFit magazine Morning Chalk Up, upwards of 70% of CrossFit affiliated gyms across the globe have already closed their doors, with the number expected to rise.  In response, ""United in Movement"" has been created by many of the biggest names in the sport with the aim of raising money for gym owners struggling with the effects of the pandemic, as well as for the Red Cross and World Hunger Organizations. READ: How a small US town became CrossFit's global mecca 'Shining light of community' The initiative will begin on April 3, with a 24-hour live stream including live follow-along home workouts hosted by some of the sport's biggest names, interviews with the stars of the sport, gym-owners and coaches, healthy cooking segments and even live music.  The event will encourage donations, with the hope of raising $1,000,000, of which 100% will be donated to causes impacted by the pandemic.  One of the board members involved in getting this initiative off the ground is Matt O'Keefe, President of Loud & Live Sports and agent to many of the top CrossFit athletes in the world.  ""In this time when we're uniquely united globally. No matter your religion, politics, language or location, you can all move,"" O'Keefe told CNN on Wednesday. ""You're stuck inside, and one thing that's free that you can do is move... have some fun with fitness, and fundraise."" Getting top athletes involved in the initiative has been easy according to O'Keefe.  ""In a time of darkness, it's been this bright shining light of community. These guys have all 100% said yes,"" he added. The sport's biggest star is 4-time CrossFit Games champion Mat Fraser, who recalled being pitched the idea by O'Keefe on United in Movement's YouTube channel. ""Don't waste your breath on me. You don't need to convince me. I am in!,"" he said. READ: Fixing 2021 sporting calendar will be like a 'huge jigsaw puzzle' READ: Mat Fraser: The loss that launched a legacy On the women's side, 3-time defending CrossFit Games champion Tia-Clair Toomey also took no persuading to get involved.  ""I thought it was a no-brainer,"" the 26-year-old Australian told CNN. ""I finally get an opportunity to give back to everyone who's supported me along my journey. We can come together through such a hard time and bring light and positivity into the world."" It's not just the world of CrossFit that's involved.  Former Major League Baseball star Jorge Posada, whose number was retired by the New York Yankees, has promoted the event and there are actors taking part, such as Oscar winner Anna Paquin and her husband, actor Stephen Moyer, as well as Wilmer Valderrama from That's 70's Show and Golden Globe nominated Max Greenfield. READ: Tia-Clair Toomey: How CrossFit's power couple met Home fitness competition The second phase of the initiative will be an online home fitness competition, consisting of 7 workouts in 7 days.  Registration will be free but will encourage donations. Ahead of the start of this week-long event, broadcast host Rory Mckernan explained to CNN how the competition would work. ""Every workout released will be accomplishable by any means necessary that you would have in your house. You wouldn't need any special equipment. You wouldn't need to go to a gym. This is something that would be available to everybody in their living room,"" he said. Scores would be self-submitted, generating a global leaderboard, where you can stack up your scores against your gym buddies and the fittest CrossFit athletes in the world.  ""It's just a reminder to everyone that we are a community and to make them feel connected,"" Mckernan explained. ""The side benefit being that we're trying to raise a tremendous amount of money for those who are really going to have an uphill battle when we find ourselves on the other side of this.""  The first workout will be hosted by the men's and women's CrossFit world champions, Mat Fraser and Tia-Clair Toomey. The live stream begins Friday night at 8pm ET with the competition beginning the following day. You can register to compete or donate at unitedinmovement.org "
"New York Times: 2,000 ventilators in federal stockpile don't work because of a maintenance lapse","Washington (CNN)More than 2,000 ventilators, a key piece of equipment to treat coronavirus patients, in the federal stockpile are unavailable to be deployed because the Trump administration failed to maintain the devices as they were in storage, according to The New York Times. President Donald Trump said Tuesday that the federal government is withholding 10,000 ventilators from distribution because of an anticipated surge in Covid-19 cases. But an additional 2,109 ventilators are out of commission because maintenance of the devices was halted during a contracting dispute, the Times reported Wednesday. States are scrambling for ventilators and requesting thousands of the devices from the federal government, only to receive a few hundred. Trump has insisted that states are requesting more ventilators than they need. When its contract with Vyaire Medical to maintain some of the stockpile ventilators expired at the end of August, the government awarded a broader contract to Agiliti, according to the Times. That led Vyaire Medical to protest the decision and the contract dispute was not resolved until January, the Times reported.  During that roughly five-month period, maintenance on the machines halted, according to the newspaper. ""We were given a stop-work order before we'd even started,"" Agiliti's chief executive, Tom Leonard, told the Times.  Experts say ventilators cannot be stored for long periods without upkeep, the Times noted. California Gov. Gavin Newsom said Saturday the state had received 170 broken ventilators from the federal government. The Department of Health and Human Services told the Times that the issues with some of the deployed ventilators were limited to their external batteries and that federal officials were quick to help the states with technical issues. Even after its contract expired, Vyaire Medical was still receiving thousands of ventilators for restoration — work that is still ongoing, according to the Times. Vyaire Medical's vice president of US sales, Aric Vacchiano, told the Times that the company has been fielding calls as hospitals hurry to get the ventilators working again. ""We're not hearing or seeing units showing up being truly or fundamentally broken,"" Vacchiano told the Times, adding that ""they probably have not been maintained."" Agiliti began maintaining the ventilators in late January, when it started becoming clear that coronavirus was a global threat, according to the newspaper. Leonard told the Times that Agiliti was not responsible for the faults in the ventilators. ""Between the time of the original and the time of this contract award, I don't know who was responsible or if anybody was responsible for those devices. But it was not us,"" he told the paper. Without giving a specific number due to its confidentiality agreement with the government, Leonard told the Times that the company still has ""that first tranche of ventilators, although we're accelerating the work to get them deployable."" ""We haven't seen or touched or had anything to do with the ones that have already been deployed to date,"" he added. An HHS spokeswoman did not reply to the Times' questions about what had occurred to the ventilator maintenance during the contract lapse.  She told the Times, however, that the agency had accelerated the contract with Agiliti to make the 2,109 ventilators available by April 30. "
"Spain passes 10,000 deaths: But the curve is stabilizing"," (CNN)Spain passed another grim milestone as it grappled to contain its coronavirus outbreak on Thursday, reporting that more than 10,000 have now died in the country as a result of the virus.CNN's Max Ramsay, Ingrid Formanek, Tim Lister and Al Goodman contributed reporting The Health Ministry said it recorded 950 new deaths in the past 24 hours, the highest single-day increase the country has seen so far. Its total death tally is now 10,003, meaning it joins Italy as the only countries to report a five-figure death toll. But there was cause for muted optimism in the country, whose devastating outbreak is slowing.  As death figures rise, the rate of new infections in Spain has fallen to its lowest rate since the start of the crisis. An increase of 3,056 cases was reported in the past day, just a 4.3% jump and a notable improvement on the dire situation in the country during mid-March. Officials said the data shows that Spain's curve of cases is coming under control, and that the drastic emergency measures put in place to lock down the country are working.  ""The data shows us that the curve has stabilized,"" Health Minister Salvador Illa said in the government's Thursday press conference. ""That we have achieved the primary objective of reaching the peak of the curve and that now we are starting the phase of deceleration."" Deaths lag behind new infections as a measure of the speed of a country's outbreak. And even the stark 10.5% rise in fatalities Spain reported Thursday is similar to Wednesday's increase, and smaller in percentage terms than any recorded in the past two weeks.  There was also a smaller increase in new patients admitted into intensive care units, with 220 admissions in the past day.   Spain's government has come under criticism from opposition parties, some health workers and unions for reported shortages of ICU facilities, lack of sufficient personal protective gear and overstretched health workers. A second makeshift morgue opened earlier this week in the capital Madrid, which has already converted a conference center into an emergency hospital and an ice rink into another morgue. And Illa warned that the country's health service remains under strain, saying: ""Even observing a decrease in the number of admissions, the long stays in these units produce an effect of accumulation of patients because of which there still remains difficult weeks for our health system."" But officials have indicated that Spain's harsh lockdown measures are having the desired effect. Health official María José Sierra said on Wednesday that the lower case numbers help ""evaluate the measures we've been taking very positively,"" and that in many communities around the country the government has seen pressure on intensive care units ease. The total number of current or active cases in Spain stood at 73,492 on Thursday, the government said. In total, it has an accumulated number of 110,238 recorded cases since the start of the epidemic. Spain has been one of the world's worst-hit countries, trailing only Italy in total deaths from Covid-19, and behind Italy and the United States in total reported cases. Its streets have laid empty for weeks as residents have been told to stay home. Meanwhile, Spaniards continue to adjust to the devastating economic impact of the pandemic. The nation registered an increase in unemployment of 302,265 people in March compared to the previous month, according to Spanish Labor Ministry data released Thursday. This increase represents the largest monthly rise since records began, Labor Minister Yolanda Diaz said at a press conference in Madrid on Thursday. She called the increase in unemployment ""absolutely exceptional"" and ""historic."" The worst-affected sector was services and tourism, with over 200,000 jobless claims, Diaz noted at the press conference. Spain's total unemployment is now 3,548,312 following a 9.3% increase in March. "
Biden says he thinks the Democratic convention will 'have to move into August',"Washington (CNN)Joe Biden said he believes the Democratic National Convention scheduled to take place in July will be pushed back a month later because of the coronavirus pandemic. ""I doubt whether the Democratic Convention is going to be able to be held in mid-July or early July. I think it's gonna have to move into August,"" the former vice president told Jimmy Fallon on ""The Tonight Show"" Wednesday night. ""We just have to be prepared for the alternative and the alternative, we don't know what it's going to be unless we have a better sense of whether this curve is going to move down or up."" As the number of confirmed coronavirus cases continues to rise across the United States, there have been unexpected changes to the election process, including postponed primaries and a virtual halt of all in-person campaigning. During an interview on MSNBC Tuesday, Biden said it was ""hard to envision"" Democrats gathering in an arena and the convention taking place as planned.  CNN previously reported that Democrats are considering a range of contingency plans for the convention, including shortening the in-person portion or going entirely digital. Biden also criticized President Donald Trump's response to coronavirus and the lack of testing kits. He said the President just started to ""grasp the reality"" of the potential death toll the pandemic will take on the country.  ""There's a sense of urgency that doesn't seemed -- only until yesterday at his press conference, the President start to grasp the reality of what he's facing in terms of the number of potential deaths, the number of people who are going to contract the virus,"" he told Fallon. ""We got a lot, a lot to do, and we're not getting it done."" During a White House press briefing Tuesday, the President warned of a ""painful"" two weeks ahead as he extended social distancing guidelines to April 30, casting a grim outlook that even if the guidelines are followed, it could still mean more than 100,000 and up to 240,000 Americans die from the virus. "
"6.6 million Americans filed for unemployment benefits last week, a record high as coronavirus takes its toll","New York (CNN Business)The last three weeks have marked one of the most devastating periods in history for the American job market, as first-time claims for unemployment benefits have surged more than 3,000% since early March. Businesses continue to lay off and furlough workers amid the coronavirus outbreak.  6.6 million US workers filed for their first week of unemployment benefits in the week ending March 28, according to the Department of Labor — a new historic high.  That was far greater than economists had expected, and more than 3,000% the pre-pandemic levels. Unemployment claims at this level suggest a severe job market decline hardly any American alive has ever seen in their lifetimes. Economists characterized the increase as ""monstrous,"" ""stunningly awful,"" and ""a portrait of disaster."" Including the prior week's 3.3 million initial claims, Americans have filed nearly 10 million jobless claims in the last two weeks alone.  That corresponds to roughly 6% of America's 165 million strong work force, which in turn implies a 9.5% unemployment rate, according to Citi economist Andrew Hollenhorst. ""Further job loss expected in coming weeks is very likely to push unemployment above 10%, even taking account of a potential steep decline in the labor force participation rate, as some displaced workers are neither furloughed nor looking for work,"" Hollenhorst wrote in a note. The rules of who can file for unemployment benefits vary by state. But in the face of the coronavirus outbreak, the government has waived some restrictions. Independent contractors and self-employed people, for example, who don't usually qualify, can now temporarily receive benefits through a pandemic unemployment assistance program Congress created. Whether this week's massive claims number was the worst of it remains to be seen. Ahead of the coronavirus outbreak, weekly first-time claims had been hovering in the low 200,000s. This ""tectonic shift"" in the US labor market ""implied a real-time unemployment rate of 10.1% at a minimum,"" said Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM. As companies continue to close their doors and shed workers to limit the spread of coronavirus throughout the population, more workers will need government aid to make ends meet. Brusuelas said in his view, the Trump administration should work on a next-phase fiscal aid package to ""target plugging the holes that are being blown in state and local budgets, in addition to Federal Reserve purchases of state and municipal debt."" The government passed the CARES Act to combat the effects from the coronavirus outbreak last week. The March jobs report, which is due Friday at 8:30 am ET, is not expected to look quite as dire. The Refinitiv consensus estimate is for a loss of 100,000 jobs, with the unemployment rate inching up to 3.8%, from its historic low of 3.5%. The March report will be more muted because the survey it is based on concludes around the middle of the month -- which was before millions of Americans filed for unemployment benefits for the first time.

Boeing offering buyouts as it projects recovery will take years,"New York (CNN Business)Boeing is offering employees buyouts as its CEO said it will take years for the airlines and aerospace industry to recover from the coronavirus crisis. In a memo to employees, Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun said the company is offering voluntary layoff packages that will provide exiting employees with pay and benefits. Calhoun said the company is doing so ""to reduce the need for other workforce actions."" Boeing had 161,000 employees at the start of this year, with about a third of them represented by unions. The aircraft maker has been hit hard by the coronavirus. Airlines around the globe have seen their revenue virtually disappear and are taking steps to cut capital spending, including aircraft purchases. ""One thing is already clear: It will take time for the aerospace industry to recover from the crisis,"" Calhoun said in the memo.  ""When the world emerges from the pandemic, the size of the commercial market and the types of products and services our customers want and need will likely be different,"" he wrote. ""We will need to balance the supply and demand accordingly as the industry goes through the recovery process for years to come. It's important we start adjusting to our new reality now."" The $2 trillion stimulus bill passed by Congress last week included a $50 billion bailout for US airlines. But most of Boeing sales are to airlines elsewhere in the world, and while bailouts are likely in some other countries, it's not clear how much help will be available. Some airlines are likely to go out of business, and most are expected to delay or cancel delivery of planes they had ordered. Boeing started the year with a backorder of 5,350 commercial jets that normally would have kept its plants building planes for years to come, since it can typically only complete about 800 jets a year. But more than 4,000 of those planes on order are destined for airlines outside of the United States. Boeing is also eligible for loan guarantees as part of that US government stimulus. The company has been taking other steps to preserve cash, including suspending its dividend payments for the first time since 1942. Last year it paid out $4.6 billion in dividends. And it also arranged to borrowed $13.8 billion from a syndicate of major banks in February, and drew down that cash last month. Boeing went into this crisis dealing with another of its own: The grounding of its best-selling jet, the 737 Max, due to two fatal crashes that killed 346 people.  It continued to build the jets for about 10 months after the grounding, but it had temporarily shutdown that line in January when it became apparent it would not get FAA approval to fly the jet again until the middle of this year. Last week it shut its other production lines in Washington state due following the death of one of the employees in Everett, Washington, due to the coronavirus. It has continue to pay its employees who are worked on those lines for at least two weeks. "
One million Australian families to get free childcare as part of coronavirus response," (CNN)About one million families in  Australia will have access to free childcare in response to the coronavirus outbreak, the country's Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced Thursday. The plan will also support the early childhood education and care sector during the crisis, according to a government press release. ""These services are vital for so many parents so they can provide for their family, and children need as much familiarity and continuity as we can help provide at this unsettling time,"" said Morrison. ""Priority will be given to working parents, vulnerable and disadvantaged children that need early education more than ever and parents with pre-existing enrolments,"" he added. Under the plan the sector will receive $1.6 billion AUD ($974 million USD) over the next three months, with payments starting at the end of next week, according to the press release. No exact date has been provided. This will help childcare facilities stay open and make it easier for Australians in essential jobs to keep working. The new temporary system will be reviewed after one month, and an extension will be considered. ""This package will help support families during these difficult times, particularly those who have lost their job and are doing it tough,"" Minister for Education Dan Tehan said in a statement. Countries around the world are grappling with how to provide for childcare so that workers can still provide essential services during the coronavirus outbreak. In the UK, schools and nurseries are shut to all but those whose parents work in a limited number of professions. "

Email thomas.lake@cnn.com if you have a story to share. (CNN)They were going somewhere dangerous, and most or all were smiling: 29 health care workers on a plane from Atlanta to the front lines of the coronavirus pandemic in New York. It was Friday, March 27. They made heart symbols with their fingers. A ramp agent took their picture, and Southwest Airlines put it on Instagram. By the following Tuesday, when the picture had circled the internet, at least one of the passengers was on the verge of tears.Americans living apart and together in the age of pandemic   ""I'm very scared,"" a nurse named Letha Love told me on the phone from a hotel in Manhattan, shortly before leaving for another overnight shift treating coronavirus patients at a Coney Island hospital. ""You can call it brave if you want to. It's brave. But I'm scared. I'm very scared. But I'm here.""   Someday, when all this is over, we'll likely put up statues of people in hospital scrubs. We'll have parades in their honor. Their names will go on bridges, highways and memorial walls. Maybe they'll get their own national holiday. Right now, though, our nurses and doctors are busy fighting for our lives. Some of them are dying.   ""I'm very scared. But I'm here."" This is both honest and courageous.  Love is 48 years old. Usually she's a nurse manager serving cancer patients at Emory University in Atlanta. Last week, when a friend told her that health care workers from Atlanta were going to New York to fight the virus, she signed up for a six-week rotation.   Her armor: shoe covers, a gown, an N95 mask and a face shield. Normally she would go through several masks per shift, throwing them away after every visit to a patient's room. But supplies are scarce, and she finds herself reusing the masks. Does this put her in more danger? Of course it does. One day you're a nurse, the next you're a patient. She has a 4-year-old daughter and a 12-year-old son, staying with relatives back in Georgia. She FaceTimes her son two or three times a day. He reminds her to put her gloves on.   Also on the flight to New York was Love's friend Trina Southerland, a registered nurse with three children. When I spoke with her on Tuesday night, she said she felt like a soldier in combat. Sometimes she wanted to give up. Sometimes she wanted to cry. ""Trina, you can do this,"" she told herself all day, on her feet, surrounded by the sick and the dying, trying hard not to touch her face. These were not complaints. They were merely statements of fact, the raw material for the stories she might be telling for decades to come. This work does not always have to feel grim. Here and there you find hope, along with a deep sense of accomplishment. ""This is the highlight of my nursing career,"" Southerland told her 16-year-old daughter, who also wants to be a nurse.   It was about 5:45 p.m. Tuesday. The bus would leave the hotel in an hour, and Love was thinking about the night ahead.   ""Covid-19 is deadly,"" she said. ""What I can say is, there is no age limit. There is no color. There is no size...There is no status, no class, no nothing. It will get anyone. ""We need support. Because it could be us laying in that bed, being taken care of by one of our fellow nurses.""   Struggling for the right words, I finally said what civilians usually say to someone going to war: ""Thank you for your service.""   ""Pray for all of us,"" she said, and went out once again to meet the enemy. "

"The coronavirus won't end moviegoing, but it could change it","New York (CNN Business)Last year was a good year for the film industry. The global box office brought in over $40 billion worldwide, even though the domestic box office was down. Disney notched seven films that made more than $1 billion globally. And one of those films, ""Avengers: Endgame,"" broke ""Avatar's"" record as the highest-grossing blockbuster of all time. Now, just three months into 2020, the film industry's year may be over. The coronavirus pandemic has brought Hollywood to a complete halt. Movie theaters, big and small, have shuttered around the world, productions have stopped and the release of some of the year's biggest films have been delayed. The future of moviegoing is in serious doubt, since nobody knows how long the virus will keep things closed or how audiences will react once life does return to normal. Jeff Bock, a senior analyst at entertainment research firm Exhibitor Relations, believes that theaters will ultimately rebound from the coronavirus outbreak, but it won't come without ""great losses.""  ""The industry is morphing before our very eyes and the old Hollywood adage, 'nobody knows anything,' is more relevant today than ever before,"" Bock told CNN Business. ""My guess is that blockbuster movies will have their day in the sun again. But the build-up to their dominance in the marketplace will take time; certainly a year, at minimum, to return to the form we recognize."" Bock added that while some smaller theaters will likely close indefinitely, even the ones that do return ""may find it more difficult to operate in the weeks and months following the crisis.""  It's easy to understand why the pandemic presents major challenges to theaters. Going to the movies is a communal experience where a group of strangers sit next to one another in a dark room for an extended period of time. Even if theaters are reopened, it may be awhile before audiences feel safe enough to go back to the movies. So while moviegoing may survive the pandemic in the long run, its near future — the rest of this year — is another story entirely. With the global box office paralyzed, the spring has been wiped clean of hit films such as Disney's ""Mulan"" and MGM's James Bond flick, ""No Time to Die."" Both films have been delayed, with ""No Time to Die"" moving to November and ""Mulan"" being pushed back to an unknown date.  The summer, which is arguably Hollywood's most lucrative season, also lost potential blockbusters such as Marvel Studio's ""Black Widow,"" which was pushed back to an unknown date, as well as Universal's ""F9"" and Sony's ""Ghostbusters: Afterlife,"" which were both postponed until next year. Sure, there are still potential hits on the docket for the rest of 2020. Paramount's ""Top Gun: Maverick"" is still set for June, Warner Bros.' ""Wonder Woman 1984"" was pushed back from June to August, and Mavel Studio's ""Eternals"" is still on for November. However, those films can't be released in theaters if none are open. ""It depends on the speed and success rate of our society's sustained response to the virus,"" Shawn Robbins, chief analyst at Boxoffice.com, told CNN Business about the potential of the movie theater industry getting back to business this year.  Robbins said that late summer seems like a ""hopeful target for the time being,"" but that ""could change on a dime depending on how this plays out.""  ""We're all playing the collective waiting game,"" he said. However, studios aren't waiting to release films to audiences. Major studios have made current films available for purchase at home — a decision that circumvented the established theatrical window, which keeps films exclusive to theaters for a few months. Universal is planning to release its latest film, ""Trolls World Tour,"" on April 10, the day it was to open in theaters. Releasing films on demand appears to be less of an industry-wide shift in how studios do business and more of a temporary solution during an unprecedented situation. Yet, the pandemic could accelerate trends that have been shaping the film business in recent years. ""This pandemic will be transformative for many businesses in ways we can only speculate. That goes for the movies too."" Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore (SCOR), told CNN Business.  Dergarabedian noted it's still unknown if this crisis ends up changing the theatrical window, but that he expects to see theaters upscaling the customer experience in a major way. ""That could mean more curated content, having better food and loyalty programs and other things that help craft an exclusive experience audiences can't get at home,"" he said. Despite the challenges that the theater industry is facing, Degarabedian doesn't believe that going to the movies is going to become a relic of the past. ""Going to the movies is baked into our collective DNA, and I'm certain it will make a comeback once movie fans feel confident and safe venturing back into public spaces,"" he said. ""We simply don't know when that day will arrive."" "
UK slammed for coronavirus testing shortfall as officials release guidance on who to save first,"London (CNN)The UK will test 100,000 people per day for coronavirus by the end of this month, UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock announced Thursday. CNN's Sarah Dean, Luke McGee, Vasco Cotovio, Barbara Wojazer, Valentina Di Donato and Ingrid Formanek contributed to this report. ""That is the goal and I am determined we will get there,"" said Hancock, who had been self-isolating for seven days with coronavirus.  But the new pledge came before the UK has even met its current target of 25,000 tests per day. Hancock set out the government's order of priority for testing people for coronavirus: Patients first, expanding to NHS (National Health Service) staff and their families, critical key workers third and ""over time we will expand to community."" He said the government intends to reach the target through a five-pillar testing strategy: 1. Swab testing in Public Health England labs and within the NHS in hospitals. 2. Partnerships with universities, research institutes and companies like Amazon and Boots to build new labs and testing sites across the country, to be initially used solely for frontline NHS staff and their families.  3. Blood tests designed to tell if people have had the virus and are now immune. These could potentially be done at home with a finger prick, Hancock said. The government is currently working with nine companies.  4. Surveys to find out what proportion of the population already had the virus, using an antibody test. There is capacity for 3,500 of these tests a week. 5. Pharmaceutical giants will assist in building a British diagnostics industry at scale. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has vowed to boost the country's coronavirus testing efforts after facing a barrage of criticism for screening fewer people than other nations at a similar stage of the epidemic. The number of deaths linked to confirmed cases of the coronavirus reached a new UK high on Wednesday, the latest figures available, with 569 deaths recorded in a day, taking the total to 2,921.  Those deaths came as the British Medical Association (BMA) released new ethics guidelines for doctors that mean older patients with a low chance of survival could have life-saving ventilators removed so the machines can be given to healthier patients. Newspaper headlines on Thursday blasted the government's failure to test more, even in typically loyal British media outlets. ""Why mass testing must be our No. 1 priority -- and why we lag behind the rest of the world,"" said the Telegraph's online edition. A spokesman for the Prime Minister told reporters Thursday that a total of 10,412 tests were carried out across the country on Tuesday. A total of 2,800 NHS workers have now been tested at drive-in testing facilities, Downing Street said. ""We acknowledge that more needs to be done in relation to testing. We need to be testing more people and we need to be making progress very quickly,"" the spokesman said. Many health workers are self-isolating after showing possible symptoms of the coronavirus but could return to work sooner if testing showed they were not infected. The latest figures come eight days after Johnson asserted that the UK was ""massively ramping up"" its nationwide testing program, and would continue to increase the number of tests carried out each week. The Prime Minister, who is himself in self-isolation after testing positive for the virus, posted a video to Twitter on Wednesday evening in which he lamented a ""sad, sad day"" in reference to the previous day's death toll of 563.  He stressed his efforts to increase the country's testing capacity, as well as listing the measures already put in place to deal with the pandemic and urging people to respect the restrictions currently in place. ""I want to say a special word about testing, because it is so important, and as I have said for weeks and weeks, this is the way through,"" Johnson said. ""This is how we will unlock the coronavirus puzzle. This is how we will defeat it in the end."" Shortage fears Earlier in the day, Paul Cosford, emeritus medical director of Public Health England, told Sky News that the UK was aiming to reach 25,000 tests a day by the middle of April. Germany's leading virologist Christian Drosten said last Thursday that his country was carrying out 500,000 tests a week. Authorities in Spain have said they are conducting between 15,000 and 20,000 tests a day.  Meanwhile, Italy has carried out more than 540,000 coronavirus tests in total, according to its Civil Protection agency. More than 34,000 were conducted nationwide on Wednesday, the agency said. In France, which has focused testing on those seriously ill in hospital and health workers, the number of tests carried out ""averages 9,000 daily,"" the National Health Agency told CNN. A health minister said Tuesday that France had the capacity to conduct 20,000 tests daily.  Cosford said Public Health England was in contact with its peers in Germany as the UK seeks to step up its coronavirus testing capacity. ""We're in constant discussions with colleagues in Germany -- and other countries -- around what they're doing, where their sources are coming from, what their supply system is. Of course we need to build this further,"" Cosford said Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty warned last Wednesday that the UK did not have ""sufficient testing"" capabilities to identify cases, telling reporters that there was a ""global shortage"" of available tests.  UK health workers have also voiced concerns that personal protective equipment and some medical supplies are running low.  The government is ""confident"" that enough protective equipment is now reaching the medical front lines, Downing Street said Thursday. In a positive development, a spin-off company of the Britain's prestigious University of Cambridge has developed a ""rapid diagnostic test for Covid-19"" which can deliver a result in ""less than 90 minutes,"" the university said in a statement Thursday. ""The SAMBA II machines, developed by Diagnostics for the Real World, provide a simple and accurate system for the diagnosis of Covid-19 infection,"" the statement said. A Cambridge hospital expects to receive the first 10 machines this week, it added. Older, sicker patients could lose ventilators The BMA said its new guidance had been prepared for doctors who will need to make ""grave decisions"" about who should receive ""scarce lifesaving resources"" if the country's health system is overwhelmed by coronavirus cases.  ""As such, some of the most unwell patients may be denied access to treatment such as intensive care or artificial ventilation,"" the BMA's ethics guidance note states.  ""This will inevitably be indirectly discriminatory against both the elderly and those with long-term health conditions, with the latter being denied access to life-saving treatment as a result of their pre-existing health problems."" It says imposing an age cut-off would be illegal, but adds that older patients with pre-existing respiratory problems would have a ""very high chance of dying despite intensive care,"" and are therefore lower priority for admission. The UK government has previously warned the country's health system could be overwhelmed if strict social distancing measures are not followed. A converted convention center in London is due to start operating this week as a massive field hospital for coronavirus cases and could soon be the biggest intensive care unit in the country. A temporary mortuary is also being built in east London as the death toll from coronavirus in the city continues to grow. "
"What you need to know about coronavirus on Thursday, April 2"," (CNN)As global cases of the novel coronavirus near the staggering milestone of 1 million, spreading to almost every country and territory, the World Health Organization chief says he is ""deeply concerned"" about the ""near exponential growth"" of the pandemic.  A version of this story appeared in the April 2 edition of CNN's Coronavirus: Fact vs. Fiction newsletter. Sign up here to receive the need-to-know headlines every weekday. In the US, the outbreak is widening and much-needed medical equipment is running out. The federal government has nearly emptied its emergency stockpile of personal protective gear, and halted shipments internationally.   Governors are pleading for supplies for inundated hospitals, as cases in the US hit more than 215,000. Today, the death toll topped 5,000 nationwide -- with over 1,300 in New York City.  NY Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo issued a warning: ""This is not just New York."" As the state's toll mounts, he urged Americans to take the virus seriously, saying the country would be living with the consequences of the outbreak for a long time. ""I don't think we get back to normal,"" Cuomo said. ""I think we get to a new normal."" In a sign of just how abnormal things have become: the nation's top coronavirus expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci -- who became a lightning rod for right-wing criticism after correcting President Donald Trump -- has been forced to beef up his personal security amid increased death threats.  YOU ASKED. WE ANSWERED Q: What's the best way to correct family members or friends who are sharing misinformation or crazy conspiracy theories?   A: Calling out loved ones can be incredibly awkward, but it is everyone's responsibility to help correct bad information -- and there are a few helpful approaches you can take: Before taking any action, it's important to remember that most people have no intention of sharing bad info; emotionally evocative content can just make people less discerning. Using an affirmative empathetic tone can help get the correction across, without making the person feel like they're being thrown under the bus.Citing authoritative sources, like health departments or local media, can make people more inclined to believe you.Talking one-on-one, and ""pre-bunking,"" simply reminding others to think about the things they share, can have a big impact.  WHAT'S IMPORTANT TODAY US joblessness claims jump Mass layoffs tied to the pandemic have sparked a surge in the number of Americans filing for their first week of unemployment benefits: 10 million in two weeks. Another 6.6 million people joined the ranks of jobless last week -- twice the record set during the week ending March 21.  Aircraft carrier cases Nearly 3,000 US sailors will be evacuated from an aircraft carrier and quarantined in hotels in Guam after a desperate plea for help; nearly 100 onboard are now infected.  The situation in Europe Yesterday, Spain recorded more than 100,000 cases, while the UK reported its highest number of deaths in one day, with 563 new fatalities. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, under fire for the slow pace of testing in the country, has vowed to do more. In Italy, a slowdown in the rate of coronavirus patients is a ""confirmation of a hope,"" officials say. Italy and Germany are among countries that are extending lockdown measures.   Lockdowns give way to crackdowns Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has ordered law enforcement officers to ""shoot dead"" any ""unruly"" people breaking lockdown. In Kenya, a 13-year-old boy was allegedly shot and killed by police enforcing a nationwide curfew last week, Citizen TV reported. Elsewhere, restrictions have become increasingly unorthodox. ln Panama, coronavirus lockdown means separating the sexes. And after advising wives to avoid ""nagging"" during quarantine, the Malaysian government has been forced to apologize. Domestic violence Lockdown measures mean victims of domestic violence have found themselves trapped at home with abusive partners. Advocates are warning the restrictions could cause a spike in violence, with some unable -- or too afraid -- to call the police. France and Spain are telling victims to head to pharmacies to report.

Experts tell White House coronavirus can spread through talking or even just breathing," (CNN)A prestigious scientific panel told the White House Wednesday night that research shows coronavirus can be spread not just by sneezes or coughs, but also just by talking, or possibly even just breathing.  Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.   ""While the current [coronavirus] specific research is limited, the results of available studies are consistent with aerosolization of virus from normal breathing,"" according to the letter, written by Dr. Harvey Fineberg, chairman of a committee with the National Academy of Sciences.     Fineberg told CNN that he will wear start wearing a mask when he goes to the grocery store.      ""I'm not going to wear a surgical mask, because clinicians need those,"" said Fineberg, former dean of the Harvard School of Public Health. ""But I have a nice western-style bandana I might wear. Or I have a balaclava. I have some pretty nice options.""     Dr. Anthony Fauci, a key member of the White House's coronavirus task force, told CNN Tuesday that the idea of recommending broad use of masks in the US to prevent the spread of coronavirus is under ""very active discussion"" by the group.     Fineberg, chair of the NAS' Standing Committee on Emerging Infectious Diseases and 21st Century Health Threats, said his letter was sent Wednesday evening in response to a query from Kelvin Droegemeier with the Office of Science and Technology Policy at the White House.     ""This letter responds to your question concerning the possibility that [coronavirus] could be spread by conversation, in addition to sneeze/cough-induced droplets,"" the letter states. ""Currently available research supports the possibility that [coronavirus] could be spread via bioaerosols generated directly by patients' exhalation,"" it continues.     According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the virus spreads from person to person when people are within about 6 feet of each other ""through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.""     Fineberg told CNN this is true, but that research shows that aerosolized droplets produced by talking or possibly even by just breathing can also spread the virus.     His letter explains that research at a hospital in China shows the virus can be suspended in the air when doctors and nurses remove protective gear, or when floors are cleaned, or when staff move around.     Research by the University of Nebraska shows that genetic material from the virus was found in patients' rooms more than 6 feet away from the patients, according to the letter.     Fineberg said it's possible that aerosolized coronavirus droplets can hang in the air and potentially infect someone who walks by later.     He added, however, that coronavirus is not as infectious as measles or tuberculosis.   How long coronavirus lingers in the air depends on several factors, including how much virus an infected individual puts out when breathing or talking, and also on the amount of circulation in the air, he said.     ""If you generate an aerosol of the virus with no circulation in a room, it's conceivable that if you walk through later, you could inhale the virus,"" Fineberg said. ""But if you're outside, the breeze will likely disperse it.""   "
Markets brace for millions of new US unemployment claims,"London (CNN Business)Mass layoffs tied to the coronavirus pandemic sparked a surge in the number of Americans who filed for their first week of unemployment benefits — the latest sign that the US economy is in for a deep recession as shutdowns aimed at containing the virus continue. A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business' Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here. The data: Over 6.6 million people filed claims for unemployment benefits in the week ending March 28, according to the US government. That is far more than economists expected and is double the all-time high set the previous week, when 3.3 million Americans filed initial claims.  The pre-coronavirus record was 695,000 claims in October 1982. Last week's claims were nearly 10 times that level. Investors will get another indication of the damage done to the US labor market on Friday, when the government publishes its jobs report for March. But Bank of America economist Joseph Song said the real trauma will be revealed later. He expects the jobs report for April to show ""unprecedented"" losses and an unemployment rate in the double digits.  The spike in initial claims last week can be attributed to a few factors. Big companies have reported layoffs or indefinite furloughs since the last report, Song observed. And the $2 trillion US relief package passed late last week made unemployment benefits more generous, while extending benefits to self-employed and gig economy workers who weren't covered before. On the radar: The previous week's figure was also revised slightly higher, from 3.28 million to 3.31 million.  Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab, warned that the previous report may have been artificially low due to a backlog of benefit applications. There's anecdotal evidence that ""a lot of people who tried to file [claims] weren't able to, because phone lines were overloaded,"" she recently told me. US stock futures shed some gains after the report posted. Dow futures are up 115 points, or 0.6%. S&P 500 futures are 0.5% higher, while Nasdaq futures have climbed 0.4%. Oil jumps on hopes of a Saudi-Russia truce Optimism that Saudi Arabia and Russia will call off their price war has sent crude prices higher — though it's not clear that two of the world's top oil producers are actually weighing a truce. The latest: President Donald Trump said during a press conference on Wednesday that he'd spoken with the leaders of Russia and Saudi Arabia and thinks ""that they will work it out over the next few days."" ""It's just too simple not to be able to,"" he said. Brent crude futures, the global benchmark, have shot up 10.4% to more than $27 per barrel as a result. US oil has rallied 10% to $22.35 per barrel. A deal would bring welcome relief to the battered oil market. Prices collapsed after a pact between Saudi Arabia and Russia to limit production broke down, exacerbating a supply glut as thirst for oil dries up. The situation is so dire that the world could soon run out of room to store all the unneeded barrels of oil, my CNN Business colleague Matt Egan reports. Whether Saudi Arabia and Russia can come to terms remains to be seen. Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak told Reuters Thursday that the country has not discussed the oil market situation with Saudi Arabia but does not rule this out. WeWork founder misses out on $1 billion SoftBank is walking away from a sizable chunk of its WeWork rescue package, which included a nearly $1 billion windfall for ousted founder Adam Neumann, my CNN Business colleague Sherisse Pham reports. Details: The Japanese tech company has backed out of a plan to buy $3 billion worth of shares in the coworking startup from existing shareholders and investors, according to statements from SoftBank and a special committee of WeWork's board. Shares in SoftBank closed up 2.5% in Tokyo following the announcement. The about face cuts deep for Neumann — the October agreement had included an offer to buy up to $975 million worth of the WeWork founder's shares — and is further evidence that SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son is stepping back from his trademark high-risk investment strategy after the company's shares cratered earlier this year. And it's a major blow to WeWork, which has been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic after its botched IPO left it on the brink of insolvency. Many cities where it operates have shut down for weeks on end. It still has to pay long-term leases, even if businesses squeezed by the outbreak cancel contracts. Up next Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) reports earnings before US markets open. Chewy (CHWY) follows after the close. Coming tomorrow: How much did the US unemployment rate tick up in March?

"In a pandemic, to baby or not to baby?","SE Cupp is a CNN political commentator and the host of ""SE Cupp Unfiltered."" The views expressed in this commentary are solely hers. View more opinion articles on CNN. (CNN)""There's never a good time to start a family,"" as the saying goes. Join us on Twitter and Facebook It's meant to reassure anxious would-be parents that there's rarely a feeling of confident preparedness that precedes having children -- and there isn't.  But the aphorism takes on a new meaning in the age of a pandemic, in which life has radically changed and the future is uncertain.   The questions are weighty and limitless: How would coronavirus and the strain on hospitals affect my pregnancy? Will we have enough money to afford kids when this is over? Will we have jobs? Would growing a family add to or alleviate some of the anxieties of life in the time of corona? Is loneliness a good enough reason to have a child?   There are also less existential, but nonetheless important, questions, like: Will adding a screaming baby to a 900-square-foot apartment just ensure my marriage's untimely demise?    Family planning in the time of a pandemic is a complicated, unmanageable Pandora's box, an endless stream of unanswerable what-ifs and worst-case scenarios. And with so many unknowns and a continual stream of unsettling coronavirus news, it's hard to imagine why anyone would choose to have a child now.   And yet, these things are hard to rationalize.    I have a 5-year-old, and after wrestling for years, practically since the day he was born, with whether or not we'd have another, we decided just this past summer that our family felt complete.    We came up with all the good reasons not to do it. The time when adding to our family would have given our son a playdate had passed -- they'd be a full six years apart, and what 10-year-old wants to play with a 4-year-old?    I am also approaching an increasingly risky age to have a healthy child, not to mention an age when the prospect of 2 a.m. feedings, potty training, and nap battles feel no less challenging than climbing Mt. Everest, and no more rewarding than eating a cat hair casserole.    And finally, we like our work-life balance. We both enjoy working full-time, and still get to spend plenty of quality time together and with our son. Why would we disrupt this admittedly enviable situation?   Being stuck at home (I know, I know ... ""safe at home"") with my husband and son has been challenging in the predictable ways. Working from home with a five-year-old requires a lot of discipline, creativity and, as it turns out, bribery.   A longing sneaks up My husband and I are learning fun new things about each other. He's handier at building projects than I knew. I'm better at cleaning than he knew. And conversely, there are new questions. Have I always been this impatient? Has he always breathed this loudly? And, whom did he delight with 1,000 questions a day before all this started?    But despite these adjustments, all this family time has had one unexpected consequence. I find myself suddenly longing for a second child.  I shared this alarming thought with a friend, who also has one child a little older than ours. And he said that he too, for the first time ever, questioned whether they should have had another.    I've decided that this could be due to a unique and unprecedented set of circumstances that's physiologically influencing my biological clock -- I'm calling them corona hormones -- in ways only this moment in time could.  For one, fear can make a mother preternaturally focused. When confronting the reality that some, perhaps many, people around us will die, procreating becomes an evolutionarily appealing act of rebellion. While the smallness of our family feels thrifty and well-suited to hunkering down in a pandemic, it also somehow feels too small for the scope of it. Strength in numbers seems the better biological approach.   That primal rationalizing is coupled with a more emotional sense of urgency. I've loved stripping away the non-essential and indulgent concerns of pre-corona life to the immediate concerns of right now. We always said nothing's more important than family, but this experience has practically turned that into a dare. I find myself mentally bargaining with coronavirus, saying, ""Take anything you want from me  -- money, comfort, convenience -- just leave my boys alone."" If family is everything, why wouldn't I want more of it?   Oddly, the obstacles that we routinely cited earlier feel less important now, even though their validity hasn't diminished at all. Can we afford another kid? Are we physically up to the challenge? Can we cut back on work? Can we do it all again? Pre-corona me was worried sick about these questions. Post-corona me feels unrealistically and undeservedly brave.     Corona-hormones?  I wonder if I'm alone. In the early weeks of coronavirus spread, a rash of headlines about an inevitable baby boom infected the internet. Some experts suggested that the increase in forced intimacy would naturally lead to actual intimacy.    Dr. Sheri Jacobson, clinical director at Harley Therapy, a clinic in London, told The Times, ""Lack of sex is a common problem between overworked couples, and remote working often has the benefits of accommodating other activities. In this early period, staying home might feel like a break from the norm, creating a short holiday effect. Couples could also be bonding over the unfolding trauma."" But sex out of boredom or opportunity isn't necessarily the same thing as desire for a bigger family. And in fact, others are predicting the coming baby boom will only look like a small blip.   In The Washington Post, Richard W. Evans, director of the Open Source Economics Laboratory, suggests that the highly contagious nature of coronavirus could stifle intimacy urges in many cases, leading to no more than a 2% increase in births this winter. Hardly a boom.     It's unlikely we can predict how coronavirus will impact family planning on a global or even national scale. So much of what is happening now is unprecedented. So, I spoke to some of my friends to get a sense of where they were, mentally and emotionally.   Alyssa is a 34-year-old, single PR and marketing executive in Washington, DC. When we were younger, we often talked about our ambivalence toward marriage and family, but now she says the pandemic has ""made me feel my desire to start a family more acutely.""    Don't you feel relieved, though, that you're not dealing with kids on top of everything else right now, I ask? ""I have had plenty of moments of gratitude that I'm the only person I have to worry about ... it makes things relatively simple that way,"" she says. ""But the flip side of that has also been something I've had to process; the isolation can feel extra isolating as a single person who lives alone, and it's hard not to notice the space that could be filled with a family.""   Tim, a single, gay 41-year-old tech professional in Palo Alto, CA, echoed the conflicting sentiments. ""I feel exhausted taking care of myself and calming myself down during this time of pandemic,"" he admits, and ""I worry about the responsibility of having to do it for others. But I also understand that having to care for someone other than oneself can be mentally beneficial. I do find myself yearning for my own crew during this lock-down.""    Urgency ... and worry While fear and anxiety have prompted an urgency in me to have another child, it's also an understandable impediment for others. Pamela, a 30-year-old unmarried communications professional in New York City, had hoped to start a family soon.    Now, she says, she has new fears. ""I'm scared of the unknown and what this means for us all weeks, months or even years from now. I can't imagine starting a family in the midst of all this, considering the financial responsibilities."" When I ask how she'd feel if she found out she was pregnant right now, she says ""bittersweet"" -- ""blessed, but concerned."" She feels connected to her nieces and nephew more than ever.    Others didn't have the luxury of planning around coronavirus. One friend who has a child already and another on the way, says she would like to have waited to have her second kid until after there was a readily available coronavirus vaccine.   For others, the road to pregnancy hasn't been easy to begin with, and coronavirus is another complicating layer.   Meghan McCain, a co-host of The View, is expecting her first child at age 35. Last year she suffered a painful miscarriage and admits that the path to motherhood ""was by no means a straight line -- physically, emotionally, in all ways.""    Now, the stress is even more acute, she told me. ""I have had to bump back scans and appointments because they were scheduled at a big hospital in the city and I didn't feel comfortable going there right now,"" she says. ""I don't know when I will be able to shop for anything baby-related, let alone get a nursery ready. I was really worried about the pharmacy running out of prenatal vitamins. Things like that make it very difficult.""    But being pregnant during a pandemic has also awakened a maternal instinct in Meghan, when it came time to decide to work from home instead of going into a New York City studio every day for her show. ""I had to think of the health implications, not only for me but my child. It really is the first time I have made a career choice thinking of someone other than myself.""    And for some, still, coronavirus has had little impact on family planning. Brooks and his husband already have the two young children they always wanted. While the challenges of the pandemic have made them feel more connected to and grateful for the community of Sunday school teachers, pre-school teachers, and friends that they relied on as parents before social distancing, he says they feel ""blessed where we are,"" and have no plans to add to their family.    As for me, I'm still assessing. It's hard to trust my feelings right now.    It seems like the rule about not making big decisions while hormonal and pregnant probably applies during the emotionally charged and mentally fraught time of corona.  To that end, we are leaning toward expanding our family at least in one way -- we've applied to adopt a shelter dog. "
Police and fire departments warn supplies for first responders running dangerously low," (CNN)When a resident at an elder care facility near Madison, Wisconsin, refused to isolate Monday night after a coronavirus diagnosis, local law enforcement responded to the call for help. On the scene, a Dane County sheriff's deputy helped subdue the person and transport them to a local hospital. She was spat on in the process. Leyla Santiago contributed to this story.  The sheriff's deputy was lucky. Though she had to pause her shift to deep-clean her uniform with specialized equipment at a fire station, she had been covered head to toe in protective gear -- gloves, goggles, a gown and a face mask separated her from the deadly virus that health officials say is spread through respiratory droplets.  As the number of coronavirus cases continues to multiply across the country, supply shortages at hospitals have come into stark view. But similar shortages are also plaguing first responders who are confronting the virus every day in the field — oftentimes before a patient even reaches the controlled environment of a hospital.  Cities and towns big and small, which employ most of the country's police officers, firefighters and EMTs, are turning to unofficial sources as they struggle to procure personal protective equipment and other supplies, like hand sanitizer, and compete for scarce federal resources.  ""I haven't heard from a place in the United States that they've got an adequate supply of personal protective equipment at every level. Everyone we've heard from has been short or out,"" said Jim Pasco, the executive director of the National Fraternal Order of Police. Many cities are looking to the federal government and the Federal Emergency Management Agency for supplies — but have often found a lengthy wait and a cumbersome process before supplies trickle down to them, particularly in locations that aren't in one of the country's coronavirus hotspots. The US Conference of Mayors conducted a survey of cities last week that starkly illustrated the problem for cities: 91% of cities that responded said they did not have an adequate supply of face masks, 88% lacked sufficient personal protective equipment and 62% said they had yet to receive emergency supplies from their state. Much of that equipment would be sent into the field for first responders. During past national emergencies, such as major hurricanes, earthquakes or wildfires, assistance would pour into cities from across the country, addressing any shortages, local officials said. But that's just not an option in the global coronavirus pandemic, where states are now bidding against one another — and the federal government — for critical supplies. ""Nobody has enough of anything, nor do I think any help is on the way,"" said Wade Kapszukiewicz, the mayor of Toledo, Ohio. ""It is our sense we are really left to fend for ourselves in a lot of ways."" Police seeking supplies elsewhere Police and fire departments across the country are scrambling. One Connecticut town's police department is turning to a supply of expired Army surplus masks for their officers. A rural Washington state county fire department set up a collection box for donations of gloves, masks and other items. Sheriff's deputies working at a northern Wisconsin jail wear bandanas to cover their faces when dealing with inmates. And across the country, distilleries and breweries are turning from producing alcohol to hand sanitizer to keep local departments stocked up. In New York City, where the highest numbers of coronavirus cases in the US has translated to more than 1,400 sickened NYPD employees, a wave of supplies bought from a private company by the New York City Police Foundation with donated funds is on its way to bolster the country's biggest police force.  Shipments of 150,000 masks, 150,000 gloves and 150,000 packets of hand sanitizers for frontline officers are expected in the coming days. ""This equipment will help keep our officers physically safe. But beyond that, it sends them a clear message -- that their unwavering commitment to protecting people is deeply appreciated,"" NYPD Police Commissioner Dermot Shea said. For smaller forces across the country, national police associations have played a key role. Groups like the National Fraternal Order of Police, the International Association of Chiefs of Police and the National Sheriffs' Association have leveraged relationships in Washington to sound the alarm about the protective equipment shortages. Pasco, with the National Fraternal Order of Police, said that the White House has been especially helpful in making connections between the law enforcement group and public health officials at the Department of Homeland Security and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Still, limited national stockpiles of protective equipment has meant law enforcement is competing with medical professionals for federal prioritization. ""There have been promises both at the federal level, as high as the President, and at the state level, that first responders will be a priority, but we're talking weeks until that equipment can be made available,"" said Dane County, Wisconsin, Sheriff Dave Mahoney, the incoming president of the National Sheriffs Association.  ""We can't neglect our first responders by providing all of our resources to the medical field. Oftentimes it is our first responders -- our police officers and deputy sheriffs and paramedics and our firefighters -- who are having the first contact with individuals who are suffering with the symptoms of Covid-19,"" Mahoney said. From booze to hand sanitizer US Conference of Mayors President Bryan Barnett, the mayor of Rochester Hills, Michigan, said in an interview that the mayors' survey released last week came at a critical time to show the federal government how many cities were lacking supplies, in addition to the shortages that hospitals are facing.  Barnett said he was hopeful that the number of cities in need of supplies would decrease in the coming weeks, but the US Conference of Mayors is also pushing for the White House to embrace the Defense Production Act to ramp up supplies, sending a letter Monday urging for ""full enforcement"" of the law. In the interim, states are turning to local businesses, donations and any other means necessary to keep their supply shelves stocked.  One particular challenge for cities has been hand sanitizer, a product that's been difficult to come by for hospitals, first responders and the general public. Cities have gotten creative to get their share of sanitizer — and the most popular source seems to be the alcohol industry. In Louisville, Kentucky, Mayor Greg Fischer said the state's bourbon makers have turned to producing sanitizer, helping keep his city supplied.  A local distillery filled an order for 1,000 gallons of hand sanitizer for Dayton, Ohio, delivering the product to first responders and frontline workers, said Mayor Nan Whaley. Toledo has been getting sanitizer from both a distillery and a brewery. In Santa Clara, California, the first coronavirus hotspot in the Golden State, the city has needed to prioritize giving sanitizer to its employees in the field over those with access to soap and water, according to the city's emergency services manager, Lisa Schoenthal. But she said the city was close to securing a contract to replenish its sanitizer stock — coming from a local distillery. ""It's the number one request we get,"" Kapszukiewicz, the Toledo mayor, said of requests from his first responders. Supplies from locals -- or China Alcohol producers transitioning from liquor to sanitizer is just one of the ways that cities have been able to get their workers the supplies they need. Carol Dutra-Vernaci, the mayor of Union City, California, said donations have helped them maintain their supply stockpile. One business donated N95 respirators to local law enforcement. A janitor supply company in the city gave a couple boxes of gloves. Even the sister cities program between the United States and China played a role: Union City's sister city, Liyang, China, donated 6,000 masks that arrived this week, now that the pandemic is subsiding in China. Dutra-Vernaci said she's asking if Liyang can spare even more. In Windham, Connecticut, the police department is planning to use a supply of expired Army surplus masks, said the town's public information officer, Matt Vertefuille. The fire department bought machines with ultraviolet light to sanitize equipment and trucks, he said. ""We are also scrambling, trying to find space for our first responders and town employees who either get exposed or infected and don't want to take it home,"" he said. Some cities are in better shape than others when it comes to supplies. Jersey City, New Jersey, Mayor Steven Fulop said his city currently has an adequate supply of personal protective equipment and hand sanitizer because it stocked up early when the first cases began appearing outside of China. ""We got our stuff in January. That has made a huge difference for where we are today, being able to provide resources to other entities that need it,"" Fulop said, adding that the city has provided some of its supplies to local hospitals. ""If we didn't have that, we'd be in a very different place."" While the federal government says it's ramping up its supply chain, many local officials said receiving those supplies can be cumbersome. While every state has a different system, cities generally have a two-step process before they receive supplies: Cities typically funnel up their requests to the state, often through counties, and then the state decides where the supplies it receives from the federal government should go. With many states receiving only a fraction of the requests for supplies through the Strategic National Stockpile, the requests from many cities are going unanswered. ""The state tries to deliver what they have, but they don't have what they need either,"" Whaley said. The supplies problem is lurking particularly in areas where the pandemic has not had a big impact. Noel Hardin, a fire chief in Asotin County, Washington, near the Idaho border, said his rural county is one of the few in Washington state that hasn't had a coronavirus case — yet. As a result, they haven't received supplies from the state, which has only been able to fill a portion of requests from counties for federal equipment. His department asked the public for donations of extra items like gloves and masks, he said, setting up a drop-off point for items. He's not facing a shortage yet — but he's most concerned about needing masks and gowns should cases begin to emerge in the county.  ""If we were to get hit with a bunch of cases all at once,"" Hardin said, ""we'd be hurting."" "
Filing for unemployment benefits? Read this first," (CNN)Unemployment benefits are becoming a financial lifeline for millions of Americans after their employers shut their doors to help stem the spread of the coronavirus. The growing tsunami of layoffs has overwhelmed state unemployment systems as a record number of workers try to apply for benefits. The situation isn't likely to improve anytime soon. The bottleneck comes as Congress passed a historic expansion of jobless benefits -- but applicants have to be able to file their first claims before the checks can start coming. The situation is so bad that governors have begun apologizing to frustrated people who can't file claims and have to wait longer for their money.  ""Unemployment benefits are extremely essential to support workers who are trying to make ends meet and stay connected to the labor market,"" said Kali Grant, senior policy analyst at the Georgetown Center on Poverty & Inequality. Here's how unemployment benefits work: The rules vary by state, but typically employees have to have lost their jobs through no fault of their own, have a minimum level of prior earnings from recent employment, be ready to take new positions immediately and be actively seeking work. States can now waive the latter two requirements since hundreds of millions of Americans are staying at home, and many states have closed nonessential businesses. Just who is eligible for unemployment benefits also varies by state. Not all part-time workers qualify. And independent contractors and the self-employed typically don't either, though Congress has created a pandemic unemployment assistance program that temporarily covers them. How much you'll receive depends on your recent earnings and state in which you live, said Chad Stone, chief economist at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Benefits range from about $200 to $550 a week, on average, depending on the state, and typically replace about 40% of one's wages. But Congress just gave those weekly checks a big boost. (See more below.) It will likely take longer to file your initial claim and have it approved because of the crush of applications, but once that's done, your first payment typically arrives in your bank account in two or three weeks via direct deposit. You'll no longer have to wait a week for benefits to start, thanks to Congress. If you are found ineligible, you can appeal, though that process likely will also take longer these days.  Here's what Congress just changed: In its recent stimulus package, Congress made several unprecedented changes to the unemployment insurance program.  Jobless workers will soon get an extra $600 a week on top of their state benefits, for up to four months. That will significantly boost people's payments. Lawmakers also added up to 13 weeks of extended benefits, on top of state programs, which vary between up to 12 and 28 weeks. Plus, the new pandemic unemployment assistance program expands eligibility to those who are unemployed, partially unemployed or unable to work because of the virus and don't qualify for traditional benefits. This also includes independent contractors, the self-employed and gig economy workers. The pandemic program benefits mirror what's available in one's state. Congress also allowed states to relax some of the rules to make it easier to approve applications. The extended benefits and pandemic program end by December 31. Here's what's happening when filers try to apply: Being able to actually file a claim, however, is another matter. It's not pretty out there -- Americans have taken to social media to lambast their state unemployment agencies for crashing websites, error messages, endless hold times and busy signals. The chaos has prompted several governors, including Mike DeWine of Ohio and Andy Beshear of Kentucky, to take to Twitter in recent days to acknowledge the frustrations. Nils Warren has been trying to file an initial claim on Florida's Department of Economic Opportunity site for the past two days, but can't make it past the first few steps. The online system won't allow the audio engineer to reset his PIN, and he can't reach anyone on the hotline. He was told by the automated phone system Wednesday that he'd receive a call back within two hours. After more than six hours, the phone rang -- but then quickly disconnected.  ""It just goes around and around,"" he said of the agency's site. ""Or it kicks you off or you get an error message. It's like Groundhog Day but worse."" The department, which has taken the system down for maintenance several times recently, apologized on Twitter Wednesday for the difficulty Floridians have had in submitting their claims. Warren, who saw all his jobs for convention centers, meetings and sporting events disappear by mid-March, is hoping the unemployment payments will help cover his utilities, groceries and mortgage bills so he doesn't have to drain his savings. He's not expecting to be booked again until the summer. Meanwhile, Texas' online system is so overloaded that the state Workforce Commission recommends people file in the middle of the night or very early in the morning. The agency's website notes that usage is lower between 10 p.m. and 8 a.m.  In New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo acknowledged Tuesday the state system was not keeping up with the demand.  ""I apologize for the pain. It must be infuriating to deal with,"" he said at a press conference.  Last week, the state's Labor Department received more than 8.2 million calls, compared to 50,000 in a typical week. Its online filing system had 3.4 million visits, compared to 350,000 normally.  The agency has dedicated 700 people to the unemployment insurance hotline and is training hundreds more. It has extended call center hours, added 20 additional servers to boost its website capacity and is processing applications on Sunday.  The state is also asking people to file on certain days, based on the first letter of their last name.  Still, even late at night, the agency's page warns it can take more than an hour to apply. ""The site is so deluged that it keeps crashing because you literally have hundreds of thousands of people at any time trying to get on the site,"" Cuomo said. ""It's compounding people's stress,"" he said. ""You're unemployed, you're trying to get on some darn website. You can't get through the website."" "
Here's why some states are exempting religious gatherings from stay at home orders," (CNN)Officials from the health care and federal and state governments have promoted social distancing as a powerful tool in the fight against coronavirus.  But of the 39 states that have implemented stay at home orders, 12 make exceptions for religious gatherings. A revival held at a church resulted in an outbreak of the virus in Hopkins County, Kentucky, and the governor reminded the public Wednesday that those exercising the exemptions still hold a responsibility to take precautions to the virus. ""The ramifications when we don't follow this, end up being widespread and they hurt people that didn't make that choice,"" said Gov. Andy Beshear. ""Let's make sure that we're responsible in the choices we make to protect those around us."" Here's a list of states that still allow some form of religious gatherings during the stay at home orders: Arizona Religious services are exempt as an essential activity because worship is protected under the first amendment of the Constitution. However, the exemption specifies that the services are exempt as long as they ""provides appropriate physical distancing to the extent feasible."" Colorado The state allows houses of worship to stay open as long as they are using an electronic platform or are practicing social distancing. Services from religious leaders are also allowed for individuals in crisis or for end-of-life services. Delaware Along with social advocacy, business, professional, labor and political organizations, religious organizations are exempt. Florida The state recognizes attending a church, synagogue or house of worship as an essential activity along with caring for loved ones, pets and recreational activities that comply with social guidelines. Kentucky Kentucky makes an exemption for life-sustaining business and religious organizations that provide ""food, shelter, social services, and other necessities of life"" for people disadvantaged or in need because of the pandemic. However, the organizations must social distance as much as possible, including ending in-person retail. Michigan Michigan also makes exceptions for operations, religious and secular, that provide necessities for those in need. The state also does not subject places of worship to penalties for breaking orders when they are used for religious worship. New Mexico The state does not include congregations in a church, synagogue, mosque or other place of worship in the definition of ""mass gatherings"" that are barred. North Carolina Traveling to and from a place of worship is exempt from the executive order as ""leaving the home and travel for essential activities."" Pennsylvania Religious institutions are exempt along with lifesaving and sustaining operations, health care, child care for employees of life-sustaining businesses, news media, law enforcement, emergency medical fire fighters and the federal government.  Texas Religious services, if they cannot be conducted at home or remotely, can be conducted as long as they are consistent with guidelines from the federal government and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. West Virginia   Attending a place of worship is considered an essential activity in the state along with going to the grocery store or gas station, picking up a prescription or necessary medical care, checking on a relative, getting exercise, and working essential jobs. Wisconsin Religious facilities, groups and gatherings must have fewer than 10 people in a room and must adhere to social distancing requirements.  "
K-pop star Kim Jae-joong apologizes after telling fans on April Fools' Day he had coronavirus,"Seoul, South Korea (CNN)K-pop star Kim Jae-joong has apologized after telling fans on April Fools' Day that he had caught coronavirus. Kim, who is a singer with boy band JYJ, told his Instagram followers on Wednesday that he was hospitalized after catching the virus, writing: ""I'm infected with Covid-19 virus."" In a now-deleted post, the pop star said he had ignored warnings by the government.  April Fools' Day is celebrated on April 1 every year and is traditionally a day when people play pranks on each other. Many of the star's 1.9 million followers expressed outrage at his remarks, with one social media user writing: ""A prank about coronavirus is not funny but childish and senseless."" The singer later apologized for his post, admitting that his judgment ""was not right."" Still, Kim's actions have caused anger -- a petition calling for the singer to be punished was posted to the Office of the President's website, and had been signed by more than 13,000 people as of 5:20pm local time [4:20am ET] on Thursday. In a statement posted to Instagram, the star claimed he was trying to raise awareness about the virus, which has killed at least 169 people in South Korea, and sickened almost 10,000.   ""First, I sincerely apologize to those who were damaged and to those whose administrative work was hindered due to a post I wrote on social media and due to Covid-19,"" Kim wrote. The singer added that he ""wanted to convey the dangers of this moment to people who don't listen while there are big and small warnings on various information media and the internet.""  When asked by a reporter on Thursday whether Kim would be punished for the post, Yoon Tae-ho, director-general for public health policy at the Ministry of Health and Welfare, said: ""Currently, cases of providing false information to an epidemiological investigator or medical personnel during epidemiological investigation or treatment can be punished according to the Infectious Disease Prevention Law."" But he said Kim's case does not fall under these conditions.  ""Whether there are other parts for punishment, (we) will have to see, but it's difficult to punish under the Infectious Disease Prevention Law,"" Yoon added during the press briefing. "
America's labor market is hurting. But this jobs report won't show the worst of it,"New York (CNN Business)The March jobs report, which will be released Friday, marks the beginning of the post-outbreak US labor market. But it won't be able to tell us just how bad things are likely to get. In recent weeks, companies have been laying off thousands of employees throughout the country and across industries — with the hospitality, leisure and travel sectors hit hardest as Americans stopped traveling or even leaving their homes.  Now the focus turns to the March jobs report, due Friday at 8:30 am ET,  the first from the Bureau of Labor Statistics since COVID-19 began sweeping across America. Economists polled by Refinitiv expect a drop of 100,000 jobs in March, bringing the 10-year stretch of continuous increases in monthly job numbers to a screeching halt. It also would push the unemployment rate to 3.8%.  In comparison, the economy added 273,000 jobs in February, when the unemployment rate stood at 3.5%, near a 50-year low. The BLS surveys on which the jobs report is based were conducted in the second week in March, when the outbreak's impact on American businesses and workers was still muted. Since then, initial claims for unemployment benefits have skyrocketed. Over the past two weeks ended March 28, nearly 10 million people filed for unemployment benefits -- 3.3 million Americans in the first week and 6.6 million in the following one. That's 6% of the American workforce. Both numbers were historical records at the time they came out. State labor departments are struggling to keep up with the onslaught of workers in need of government assistance. The March report's drop in jobs ""will likely be dwarfed by job losses closer to 10 million in April, with the unemployment rate rising above 10%,"" said economists at Citi in a note. The April jobs report is due on May 8, and will be a far better measure of the pandemic's impact on the labor market. Last week, James Bullard, president of the Federal Reserve of St. Louis, said the unemployment rate could soar as high as 30%. ""Sadly we're only at the start of this process. There are around 18 million jobs, mostly in the service sector, at risk from social distancing,"" said James McCann, senior global economist at Aberdeen Standard Investments, in emailed comments. McCann thinks unemployment could climb as high as 12% overall. "
Anger as Japanese Prime Minister offers two cloth masks per family while refusing to declare coronavirus emergency,"Tokyo (CNN)Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is facing a public backlash after he said the government would distribute two reusable cloth face masks per household amid growing concern over medical shortages as the country faces a worsening coronavirus outbreak.一世帯に二枚のマスク #贋作 #○○風に時事ネタを振り返ろう pic.twitter.com/43j8zUizyKCNN's Harmeet Kaur contributed to this report. The number of confirmed cases of the virus has spiked in recent weeks, after it appeared that Japan's initial response had got the virus relatively under control. As of Wednesday, there were more than 2,300 cases across Japan, and 57 deaths, according to a Johns Hopkins University tally.  That spike has seen a raft of new restrictions put in place in Tokyo and other major cities, and a run on protective gear, including face masks. On Wednesday, Abe said the provision of cloth masks to the worst hit areas ""will be helpful in responding to the rapidly increasing demand.""  But Abe's proposal to send two masks to each household attracted outrage and mockery online Wednesday, with the hashtag ""Abe's mask"" and ""screw your two masks"" trending on Twitter.  Many felt the move was lackluster and would not go into effect fast enough to have a chance at curbing the spread of the virus, with masks not due to be distributed until the end of the month. Others dubbed the policy ""Abenomask policy"" as satirical memes showing well-known cartoon characters sharing one mask between four family members popped up online.  The anger comes as Abe resisted calls Wednesday to declare a state of emergency, saying that use of such powers was not imminent.  A declaration of a state of emergency would allow prefectural governors to send out a stronger message when it comes to urging the public to stay at home, but the measures will not be legally binding.  Last week, Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike urged residents in the city of roughly 13.5 million to telework where possible and avoid bars, restaurants and public gatherings up until April 12. Tokyo has now extended the closure of schools and public facilities like zoos and museums up until May 6. Koike on Tuesday called on Abe to issue the national emergency declaration, after the capital recorded 78 new cases, its highest single-day jump so far.  Explosive surge  Abe said the government would prioritize distributing masks to around 50 million households in areas where coronavirus infections have been spiking. The distribution will kick off later this month and each household with a registered postal address will receive the masks through the post, part of a wider coronavirus economic package that the government is rolling out.  Over the past week, Japan has scrambled to avert an explosive surge in infections. While the current tally stands at around 2,300 cases, Japan -- a country of over 127 million people -- has only tested just over 30,000, compared with 394,000 tests carried out in neighboring South Korea, which has a population of just over 51 million.  The apparently low infection rate has created what many experts fear is a false sense of security, with people still going out in public, some not wearing masks, to see cherry blossoms, a traditional spring pastime.  On Wednesday, medical experts warned that Japan's healthcare system would not be able to bear the strain if coronavirus infections continued to spread. A government panel warned that though Japan has not seen an explosive increase in infections so far, hospitals and medical clinics in Tokyo, Aichi, Kanagawa, Osaka and Hyogo were increasingly stretched and that ""drastic countermeasures need to be taken as quickly as possible."" Economic repercussions are also a concern. Earlier this week, Japan's ruling party pledged to secure a 60 trillion yen ($556 billion) stimulus package to cushion an economy already hit by the postponement of the Olympics and coronavirus pandemic. DIY masks amid shortages While Abe's cloth mask proposal was met with anger, Japan isn't the only place mulling the use of improvised facial wear, amid widespread shortages in proper protective gear.  Mask use has been widespread in Asia since the beginning of the pandemic, but shortages and conflicting advice in many western countries has caused many people to go without, despite widespread evidence that masks help protect against the spread of the virus.  Cloth masks are not as effective as surgical masks or respirators, but they do offer limited protection and are easier to produce.  Across the US, people have been stepping up to create homemade masks for health care workers and other high risk populations amid widespread shortages and complaints from hospitals that they are not receiving supplies fast enough. In March, US retailer JOANN Fabrics and Craft Stores released a video tutorial on how to make face masks. The retailer encouraged people to drop them off at store locations, where they will be donated to local hospitals. But with a dwindling supply of N95 respirators and a surge in virus cases, healthcare facilities are bracing for the worst, and Japan may not be the last country to distribute cloth masks to its citizens.

"5 things to know for April 2: Coronavirus, health, guns, NASA, Daniel Pearl","If your day doesn't start until you're up to speed on the latest headlines, then let us introduce you to your new favorite morning fix. Sign up here for the '5 Things' newsletter. (CNN)The Democratic convention is a little more than 100 days away. Joe Biden says it's difficult to imagine it will go on as planned, given coronavirus measures.  Here's what you need to know to Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day.  (You can also get ""5 Things You Need to Know Today"" delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) 1. Coronavirus  The global tally of coronavirus cases is inching ever closer to the grim 1 million mark. In the US, more than 40 spring breakers have tested positive for the virus after taking a flight from Austin, Texas, to Mexico in defiance of public health advice. In Uganda, members of a world-renowned children's choir have fallen ill after returning from the UK two weeks ago. Some countries have taken drastic measures to curb the social spread of the disease. Panama has resorted to separating genders, allowing women and men to run errands in public on alternating days. In the Philippines, President Rodrigo Duterte has warned that people who are ""unruly"" or who break quarantine may be shot by police. In South Asia, experts worry coronavirus protection measures may provide an opportunity for organized crime to surge in the region. More than 939,000 cases of coronavirus have been reported worldwide, and over 47,000 people have died. Follow updates here.    2. Health  Not enough equipment, not enough tests: That's the reality facing American health care workers. The Trump administration says it will no longer ship personal protective equipment to allies overseas while there is such a critical shortage at home. Officials at the Strategic National Stockpile have shipped out the last rounds of its inventory, depleting the bulk of protective gear long before need across the country is met. The White House coronavirus task force may also soon recommend the public wear masks, since it appears countries in Asia where the practice is common are seeing lower infection rates and faster containment. As for tests, one of the nation's largest commercial labs faces a backlog of about 160,000 coronavirus tests, delaying results by up to 10 days.  3. Guns It's not just toilet paper people are rushing to buy. The FBI reported 3.7 million gun purchase background checks in the month of March, a 41% surge that indicates more and more people are trying to buy guns. Updated guidance from the federal government has designated firearm and ammunition retailers as essential services, which means they can stay open despite a growing number of states issuing stay-at-home orders. The decision is a victory for Second Amendment rights groups, some of which had already filed lawsuits in places where gun retailers weren't exempted in stay-at-home orders.    4. NASA For the first time since the final space shuttle mission in 2011, NASA says astronauts will launch into space aboard an American rocket and spacecraft from American soil. The agency is partnering with SpaceX for a manned SpaceX Demo-2 flight test in May from Kennedy Space Center. Of course, this launch date could be postponed depending on the state of the coronavirus crisis. This is a big step for NASA's Commercial Crew Program. By facilitating commercial spaceflights, the agency says it's providing another way for astronauts to get to and from the International Space Station. And it looks like a lot of people are interested in blasting off: More than 12,000 people applied to be part of NASA's next class of astronauts.  5. Daniel Pearl A local court in Pakistan has overturned the death sentence and murder convictions of four men believed to be involved in the 2002 killing of American journalist Daniel Pearl. All had been in prison for 18 years. Three were handed life sentences, and a fourth, Ahmad Omar Saeed Sheikh, was awaiting execution. The high court in Pakistan's southern province of Sindh vacated Sheikh's murder conviction and reduced his sentence to a shorter prison term for kidnapping. Pearl was working as the South Asia bureau chief of the Wall Street Journal when he was kidnapped by militants in Pakistan and later murdered. His death shook the international community and sowed dread regarding the rise of radical Islamist terrorism.  BREAKFAST BROWSE Dolly Parton donates $1.1 million to coronavirus research  And weeee will always love her.  JK Rowling launches 'Harry Potter at Home' hub for bored children  When all else fails, escape to Hogwarts!  Nature documentaries are offering an escape for cooped-up viewers ""Oh right, that's what the outside looks like again!""

This Midwestern mayor is fighting to get her residents to take coronavirus seriously," (CNN)Topeka, Kansas, Mayor Michelle De La Isla has a mission: Convince the residents of her medium-sized, Midwestern city who have not been touched by the coronavirus pandemic that this is their fight too. During news conferences she posts online, she pleads with people to listen to the facts and to understand what could be coming their way. But Topeka, home to some 125,000 people, is not experiencing the worst of the crisis that has rocked major population centers and the coastal areas of the United States. Kansas had only 482 confirmed cases of Covid-19 out of the more than 200,000 cases in the nation, as of Wednesday evening. The disparity has put De La Isla, a single mom and the first Latina mayor of Topeka, in the position that many other local officials are in around the country: Implementing and enforcing the same strict distancing guidelines seen in the most impacted parts of the country on populations who haven't come face-to-face with the disease, all to try to slow and stop the spread of the virus. Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly, a Democrat, issued stay-at-home instructions earlier this week, but as mayor of the state's capital city, implementing that falls largely to De La Isla, also a Democrat, and the local officials she works with. ""One of the biggest challenges that we're having is that because we don't have the numbers that the coast has, we are challenged by people not understanding the gravity of the situation. So we're having to tell people, and tell people again, about social distancing, and encouraging people to make sure that they follow the order of the ordinance that we put out, so that we can protect people,"" De La Isla told CNN in a virtual interview. ""We are two weeks behind the virus on a regular basis,"" she added. ""We're trying as much as we can, but again the numbers here don't seem to faze people the way that they should."" De La Isla spoke to CNN from Topeka's emergency operations center, where she and other city leaders like Dusty Nichols, the Director of Emergency Management, work together daily with a battle rhythm. For the mayor, suddenly thrust into confronting a worldwide pandemic at home, the pace of her days can be overwhelming. Formerly homeless herself, focusing on those in need Born in New York City, De La Isla grew up largely in Puerto Rico. She experienced homelessness during her childhood and became a teenage mother but was able to go to college and graduate from Wichita State University, eventually moving to Topeka. She worked in public advocacy, including for Habitat for Humanity, before winning a seat on the City Council in 2013 and narrowly winning her mayoral race in 2017.  De La Isla still calls the homeless ""my people"" and is now working overtime to try to find a place for those who go to shelters to be properly separated, because right now, she told CNN, ""there is not enough space for social distancing for this group of people that need our help."" She reads to children live on Facebook to help Topeka's parents who are ""going crazy trying to figure out how to keep their kids entertained."" She posts videos of herself bike riding to show how to safely exercise outside.  ""If you let the whirlwind take you, you are going to just go all directions, especially in crisis time,"" she said. What grounds her, De La Isla said, is a morning meeting with her team. ""We know that at 8:00 in the morning, this team meets,"" she said. ""Every single day, we have a touch point in which we will meet with our group and delegate,"" she added. One of those delegated tasks in these times: a new ""Rumor Control Group"" to combat bad information. For example, people saying the city is under martial law, or that someone who had tested positive for coronavirus went into a certain business place, which was not accurate. ""When we hear a rumor, we all talk about it in the (public information officers') meeting in the morning, and then we say, 'Okay, here's how we're going to disseminate this,' and then based on some of the contact that we have from the community, we create PSAs, so that the message that we want to stick, sticks,"" she explained. Focusing on mental health De La Isla puts a premium on tending to the mental health of her city's rattled residents. Her team set up what they call a ""warm line"" (instead of a ""hotline"") for people in distress. ""The whole idea is figuring out how to pair volunteers in the community that are looking for something to do because they care and they want to do something positive, but also, providing an avenue for the people that are at home, struggling with anxiety, feeling lonely and needing somebody to call in and check in on them,"" said the mayor. For students who are now learning in homes without proper wireless internet, she and the city's school superintendent are converting school buses into portable hotspots so that children can do their homework. She and her team are working with churches and other non-profit groups to make sure that children who rely on free or reduced-price lunch maintain access to food. De La Isla has two teenage daughters at home. Like families all across the country, they are trying to make it all work with kids suddenly home. Her daughters babysit her nephew so that both she and her sister, a bank teller, can get to work. De La Isla says what keeps her up at night is whether doctors will have enough equipment if the virus hits Topeka hard, and whether the city's two hospitals, which serve surrounding counties as well, have enough beds. ""Like all the hospitals across the nation, (we) need PPE (personal protective equipment). ""If at any point in time any of our senior centers gets impacted, we have the potential of, just in Topeka, with a few senior centers, to take over all of those beds and all of those ventilators,"" De La Isla said. Congressional campaign on hold Before the coronavirus crisis, De La Isla, was laser focused on her campaign for Congress -- hoping to unseat Republican Rep. Steve Watkins. She says that although she touches base with her campaign staff after hours, it is effectively on hold.  ""My message to everybody has been if I am not a great mayor at this time, I don't deserve to be your congresswoman,"" she said. In a statement to CNN, the GOP incumbent said right now, they are working together. ""Mayor De La Isla and I will battle on the ballot in November, but right now we are all at war with a common enemy, Covid-19,"" Watkins, a freshman, said. De La Isla is singing from the same nonpartisan song sheet. ""I want to make sure that our community understands that they are loved. I use the word often because I see the city as my family, my community, and I absolutely love all of my citizens. Even when we don't agree,"" she said. "
"When a retired janitor died, crowds flocked to his funeral and mourned together. Within weeks, their city was overrun by coronavirus cases","Albany, Georgia (CNN)When a retired janitor suddenly died in southern Georgia, crowds of relatives and friends flocked to a local funeral home and mourned together. Within weeks, their city was overrun by coronavirus cases.CNN's Amir Vera, Erica Henry and Christina Maxouris contributed to this report.  That cluster of coronavirus cases was linked to the funerals of 64-year-old Andrew J. Mitchell and another man, held in late February and early March, Dougherty County Council Chairman Chris Cohilas said. Albany, a city of roughly 75,000 people -- as well as Cohilas' county, where Albany is based -- is the latest example of how the virus has started disrupting smaller, more rural areas as much as the country's larger, urban cities.   As of Wednesday afternoon, there were at least 490 confirmed coronavirus cases reported in Dougherty County and at least 29 coronavirus-related deaths, the Georgia Department of Public Health said. About 20 people who attended at least one of the funerals contracted the virus, said Scott Steiner, the chief executive officer of Phoebe Putney Health System, which has its biggest hospital in Albany.  ""It took one person, whoever that was, and there was no intent,"" Steiner told CNN. ""It shows this virus can quickly spread."" A spokesperson for the Georgia Department of Health acknowledged the virus spread among ""individuals who attended a number of events in Albany"" but said it's unclear ""where or with whom it all started."" 'It was like a domino effect' Emell Murray discovered her long-time companion, Andrew J. Mitchell, unconscious in the living room of their home on February 24. The family said they suspect he had a heart attack and died.  After his passing, their siblings, nephews, nieces and friends traveled to Albany to pay their respects at his funeral service, and later spent the afternoon at Murray and Mitchell's home. A couple of days later, Murray, 75, was hospitalized. She had a fever and her blood pressure skyrocketed. ""We didn't know what was wrong with her,"" Alice Bell, Murray's daughter, told CNN.  Murray spent much of March at the hospital. In between visits, doctors informed her she had tested positive for coronavirus. But she wasn't the only one.  Several of the couple's relatives contracted the virus, Bell said. The pastor who delivered Mitchell's eulogy, she said, has since died of coronavirus complications. Steiner, the hospital system CEO, confirmed that.   ""It was like a domino effect,"" Bell said.   The Martin Luther King Memorial Chapel LLC, which hosted the respective funerals on February 29 and March 7, said health department officials notified them on March 13 about a potential exposure to the virus involving people who were present at the events. The AJC first reported the funerals as the source of the city's outbreak. ""Although we have been identified as a common factor in the tracking of the Covid-19 in Albany, know that we are operating within all regulatory safety or health guidelines,"" the funeral home directors wrote in a Facebook post. ""We know that there is growing concern across the city. We are taking extra precautions to protect you, our staff and the communities we serve."" The funeral home did not respond to CNN's repeated attempts for comment. The cluster of cases began emerging shortly after a 67-year-old man tested positive for the virus. The man traveled from Atlanta to attend one of the funerals and was hospitalized in Albany during his trip, said Steiner, the hospital system's CEO. ""The next day it's when we began seeing people coming to our emergency room who were sick,"" Steiner said. ""Two (people) the first day, six the next day, eight the next day, and it just began to cascade from that point."" Some of those patients had attended the funerals, others were members of the same churches, Steiner said. Life changed quickly in Albany  The virus had been traveling through this close-knit community for several weeks by the time social distancing warnings came in. Before the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued guidelines limiting gatherings to 50 people in mid-March, hundreds of runners flooded the city's streets for the Snickers marathon and half-marathon -- one of the top 10 qualifiers for the Boston Marathon. They enjoyed live music during a downtown festival and packed the local churches on Sundays. As more people fell sick, Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp told reporters that he was concerned about the growing number of cases in Albany.  ""This situation cannot be more serious,"" Kemp said on March 19. ""Stay home if you are sick. If there's any doubt, stay home. We've had this happen in many places around the state, with sick individuals attending funerals which has created one of the hot spots we have around the state. I think it's a good example we can all learn from."" Local officials declared a state of emergency on the same day, banning community gatherings of more than 10 people after four coronavirus-related deaths were reported. A stay-at-home order followed a few days later. The state sent its national guard to help The epicenter of the pandemic for the coronavirus outbreak quickly changed from Washington to New York. As that happened, the virus' impact also became evident in Georgia. Georgia has at least 4,748 confirmed coronavirus cases, and at least 154 deaths in the state. The highest number of cases has been reported in Fulton County -- which includes Atlanta, and has a population of about 1 million people. But Dougherty County -- which has a population of about 85,000 people, and where Albany is -- is a close second. Earlier this week, Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House's coronavirus response coordinator, urged rural communities in the US to prepare for the spread of Covid-19, ""even though you think it's not there."" Health care workers at Phoebe Putney Health System went through six months' worth of supplies in less than a week, Steiner said. Some health care workers are sleeping in their garages to protect their families and the intensive care units are quickly filling up. Kemp deployed Georgia National Guard medical teams to Phoebe Putney Memorial Hospital, which has been the most inundated with patients. He's also deploying more than 100 Guard troops to long-term care facilities throughout the state that have seen coronavirus cases.   He said Wednesday that Georgia hospitals might reach peak hospital capacity on April 23.  For CaMia Hopson, an Albany state representative who lost a friend to coronavirus, life in the region feels like it will never be the same. ""We weathered tornadoes, hurricanes, everything ... but our entire world is dealing with something that we haven't seen in our lifetime,"" Hopson told CNN. ""People are grieving, we are really hurting right now. We are not New York, but we are still impacted."" "
Australia will impose huge fines for illegally exporting medical supplies amid coronavirus pandemic," (CNN)The Australian government will punish people convicted of illegally exporting masks, hand sanitizer or other personal protective equipment with hefty fines, under newly invoked biosecurity laws. Home Minister Peter Dutton's office said in a statement Wednesday that the fines were one of several new emergency measures being adopted by the government to keep dwindling medical supplies inside the country as doctors attempt to contain the spread of the coronavirus. To date, more than 5,000 people in Australia, including Dutton himself, have contracted the virus. Under the new measures, authorities have amended customs regulations to ""stop exploitative exports of essential goods,"" and to ensure that all surrendered medical supplies are redistributed to the national stockpile. Violating the customs law is punishable by a fine of up to 210,000 Australian dollars ($128,275), while those found guilty of violating the Biosecurity Act could face up to five years in prison and a fine of up to 63,000 Australian dollars ($38,480), Dutton's office said. ""These measures have become necessary because we have seen a small number of individuals engaging in the bulk purchasing of essential goods from retail outlets in Australia, with the intent of profiteering from exploitative exporting and price gouging,"" the statement read. Like many countries around the world, Australia is currently dealing with a shortage of equipment needed to protect medical workers treating patients who have contracted the novel coronavirus. ""We've taken the steps to protect Australia's interest, to stop unauthorized, inappropriate exporting of those things that we rely upon for our health care and so on at present,"" trade minister Simon Birmingham said in an interview with Australia's ABC News yesterday. Other countries like the United States and South Korea have enacted similar measures or are considering them. "
39 US states have ordered residents home after experts continue pushing for aggressive measures to fight coronavirus," (CNN)The novel coronavirus has a strong grip in the United States and the nation's top infectious disease expert says the whole country should already be under orders to stay at home. CNN's Dave Alsup, Elizabeth Cohen, Jacqueline Howard, Elizabeth Joseph, Kristina Sgueglia, Shawn Nottingham, Amanda Watts, Joe Sutton, and Ryan Browne contributed to this report.  ""I don't understand why that's not happening,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Thursday on CNN's Global Town Hall, ""Coronavirus: Facts and Fears."" ""If you look at what's going on in this country, I just don't understand why we're not doing that,"" Fauci added. ""We really should be."" More than 90% of the US population will be under a local or state order this week but Fauci and other officials have said stricter measures are needed to slow down the spread of the virus. President Donald Trump said Thursday his administration will soon release nationwide recommendations on wearing face masks. Some cities are already asking people to wear face coverings if they need to go out. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio issued the new guidance Thursday, urging people to cover themselves to reduce the risk of transmission. ""It could be a scarf. It could be something you create at home, like a bandana,"" de Blasio said.  Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti made a similar recommendation Wednesday, though he asked people not to wear medical or surgical masks. In Laredo, Texas, residents will receive fines of up to $1,000 if they don't cover their noses and mouths with ""some form of covering"" when entering a building open to the public, using public transportation or pumping gas. A city order that went into effect Thursday says all residents older than 5 should wear face coverings, including homemade masks, scarfs and bandanas. But a top White House health adviser has strongly cautioned that masks should not lull Americans into a false sense of security. ""It is not a substitute for the presidential guidelines (on social distancing) that have already gone out,"" Dr. Deborah Birx, coordinator of the White House coronavirus task force, told reporters. ""Don't get a false sense of security that that mask is protecting you exclusively from getting infected."" The number of cases surpassed 1 million worldwide Thursday and more than 52,000 people have died from the virus, according to Johns Hopkins University statistics. The total includes confirmed cases from 180 countries and regions. In the United States -- now the country hardest-hit by the pandemic --  the virus has already infected more than 242,000 people from coast to coast.  'It's within our power to modify those numbers' Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top US infectious disease expert, said Thursday the country can still defy alarming projections of coronavirus deaths with aggressive measures -- even as scientists warn the White House that simply exhaling may be enough to spread the virus. Models had showed that the US death toll could be at least 100,000 with aggressive social distancing, White House experts said earlier, and as high as 2.2 million without them. But, ""it's within our power to modify those numbers,"" Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told ""CBS This Morning"" on Thursday. ""If you really push hard on mitigation ... you can modify the model,"" Fauci said. ""We need to push and push with the mitigation to try and get that number lower than the projected number."" As of Thursday evening, at least 242,095 people in the United States have been infected and at least 5,831 have died, according to Johns Hopkins University statistics. More than 920 of those deaths were reported Wednesday -- the highest number reported in the country since the beginning of the outbreak. Fauci's comments come after a prestigious scientific panel told the White House on Wednesday night that coronavirus can be spread not just by sneezes and coughs, but also by talking or maybe even just breathing. ""While the current (coronavirus) specific research is limited, the results of available studies are consistent with aerosolization of virus from normal breathing,"" according to a letter written by Dr. Harvey Fineberg, chairman of a committee with the National Academy of Sciences.  With the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimating 25% of coronavirus carriers have no symptoms, health officials such as Fauci have said they're considering whether to recommend the general public wear non-hospital-grade masks to prevent the virus's spread. Recent developments • About 6.6 million US workers filed for their first week of unemployment benefits last week, data released Thursday shows. That's double the record set a week earlier: 3.3 million. •  Louisiana's coronavirus cases jumped by more than 2,700 in 24 hours, bringing its total to more than 9,000, the state health department said Thursday. •  The US Food and Drug Administration has authorized a coronavirus test that looks for antibodies in the blood. The FDA says it is reasonable that it ""may be effective in diagnosing Covid-19."" The CDC also has said it is trying to develop a similar antibody test to identify people who had been previously infected but showed little or no symptoms. • More than 2,000 ventilators in the federal stockpile are unavailable for deployment because they weren't maintained while in storage, according to The New York Times. • More than 110 sailors from USS Theodore Roosevelt, now at port in Guam, have tested positive for coronavirus, according to a US defense official. Some of the sailors from the Roosevelt will be quarantined in hotel rooms in Guam. New York doctor says she feels like 'a sheep going to slaughter' Doctors and nurses across the country have spoken out about the difficulty of helping an increasing number of Covid-19 patients with dwindling amounts of protective equipment, ventilators and beds. In hard-hit New York, nurses and other medical personnel at the Bronx's Montefiore Medical Center Moses Division told reporters they desperately needed N95 masks and other protective equipment. A third-year resident there said she goes to work feeling ""like a sheep going to slaughter."" ""My colleagues and I are writing our last will and testament. I'm 28 years old,"" Dr. Laura Ucik said. ""We fear that we may not survive this pandemic and yet we show up every day,"" she said. ""We're running out of (personal protective equipment), we're running out of pain medicine, we're running out of sedatives, we're running out of oxygen masks."" Thursday, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo  estimated that his state had ""about six days"" before its stockpile of ventilators, which he is sending to hospitals in need, runs out. A day earlier, he cited a model that showed as many as 16,000 New Yorkers could die from the virus.  New York, now the epicenter of the outbreak, has reported more than 92,000 cases and 2,317 deaths. More than 51,000 of those infections have been in New York City, Cuomo said Thursday.  About 21,000 out-of-state medical professionals have volunteered to come into New York, Cuomo said Thursday. ""I thank them, I thank their patriotism, I thank their dedication and passion to their mission of public health,"" he said. This week, the Federal Emergency Management Agency sent hundreds of ambulances, EMTs and paramedics to New York City to help assist first responders. Emergency medical services received a record number of emergencies each day, with a 50% increase over normal daily call volume, the New York City Fire Department said in a news release. On Tuesday alone, FDNY EMS responded to 6,010 medical calls, Jim Long, a spokesperson for the department, told CNN. 'What are you waiting for?' California governor says to states without stay-at-home orders Nearly 92% of the US population lives in jurisdictions with general ""stay-at-home"" or ""shelter-in-place"" orders.  Most governors issued them statewide, and many counties and cities have issued orders where statewide orders aren't in place. California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who in March became the first governor to issue a statewide order, argued that every state needed one. ""What are you waiting for? What more evidence do you need?"" he said Wednesday ""If you think it's not going to happen to you, there are proof points all over the United States, all over the world."" President Donald Trump said Wednesday he would not issue a national stay-at-home order because different states have different infection rates.  ""You have to look -- you have to give a little flexibility. If you have a state in the Midwest, or if Alaska for example doesn't have a problem, it's awfully tough to say close it down. We have to have a little bit of flexibility,"" he said.  Early data: Malaria drug could shorten recovery time Some new data from researchers in Wuhan, China, suggests the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine could significantly shorten the time it takes for Covid-19 patients to recover from illness. In this early research, posted to the online health sciences server medRxiv on Tuesday, the researchers wrote that ""the body temperature recovery time and the cough remission time were significantly shortened"" among patients treated with hydroxychloroquine compared with a control group not treated with the drug.  The research has limitations, including that it was conducted in a very small group of patients with mild illness and has not been published yet in a peer-reviewed journal.   The FDA has yet to approve a treatment for Covid-19. However, this week it granted emergency authorization for doctors to use hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine to treat hospitalized patients for a limited set of cases, and clinical trials are pending. The Chinese study is promising, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the chief of the infectious disease department at Massachusetts General Hospital, told CNN Thursday. But, she cautioned, ""we're not sure this can be generalized to all patients,"" she said. ""They gave it to people who didn't have (other chronic conditions), like cardiovascular comorbidity and liver disease and renal disease,"" Walensky said. The research at Wuhan's Renmin Hospital focused on 62 patients --  31 who received hydroxychloroquine for five days, and 31 in a control  group who received standard care. More than 80% of the patient receiving hydroxychloroquine had improved pneumonia, compared to 54.8% of the control group. CORRECTION: This story has been updated to give the correct estimate for how many Americans live in states where they've been ordered to stay at home. "
The two-time cancer survivor knew he could contract coronavirus when he walked into work to treat patients," (CNN)New Jersey emergency room doctor Frank Gabrin knew he could contract coronavirus when he walked into work to treat patients. But still he continued, and about a week after contracting the virus Gabrin died in his husband's arms Tuesday. His loss is a lesson on the importance of caring for the people who are caring for the public, his friend Debra Vaselech Lyons told CNN's Chris Cuomo on Cuomo Prime Time. ""It's not about the outcome, you don't get to save every patient, but it's about what you do with the outcome,"" Vaselech Lyons said Gabrin believed. ""He lost his life needlessly because if he'd had the equipment -- he's a professional, he knew how to protect himself.""  ""We need to make something good come from this,"" she said. Gabrin's husband, Arnold Vargas, spoke alongside Vaselech Lyon's about the loss of his husband but could barely make out the words through his tears.  The two-time cancer survivor tried to make the best of things when coronavirus struck, but Vaselech Lyons said, ""it went from manageable to unmanageable overnight."" He contracted the virus, and about a week later died in Vargas's arms. Paramedics worked for an hour to save him, but he was already gone, Vaselech Lyons said.  He knew he was putting himself in a dangerous position going into work, but he -- like other medical professionals -- prepared his whole life to be on the frontlines and helping people.  What he didn't expect was to be on the frontlines without the equipment he needed. ""It's like asking a soldier to go to the frontline and giving them nothing. Nothing to do their job,"" Vaselech Lyons said.  Doctors, nurses and other medical staff across the nation are facing shortages of personal protective equipment, like masks and gloves. Many are having to reuse items considered single-use. Not only does the shortage make it difficult to protect themselves, but many states are reporting shortages of ventilators and hospital beds needed to treat their patients.   Now, Gabrin's husband is mourning his loss while suffering from the virus, too. ""I don't think we are seeing that we have selfish healthcare workers right now, they're doing what they can even though they are putting themselves and most importantly their families at risk as well,"" Vaselech Lyons said.

Trump's Covid-19 lapse gives China an opening,"Charles A. Kupchan is Professor of International Affairs at Georgetown University and Senior Fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.

The opinions expressed here are his own. Read more opinion at CNN. (CNN)Americans know all too well the adverse impact of the Covid-19 pandemic right here at home: the lost lives, the gravely ill, the overwhelmed hospitals, the severe economic downturn and spiking numbers of unemployed, the social isolation.Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook   But they should also recognize that the pandemic is doing significant harm to the nation's influence and image abroad. Countries around the world still look to the United States to provide global leadership. When it comes to Covid-19, however, Washington has been missing in action, dealing the United States a self-inflicted wound.   After the Ebola crisis broke out in 2014, the Obama administration jumped to it, turning to international teamwork to contain and stamp out the epidemic. In contrast, the Trump administration has been egregiously slow off the mark not only in preparing for and responding to the pandemic at home, but also in coordinating an international response.   The absence of US leadership has taken a particular toll on relations with America's traditional allies in Europe. Transatlantic relations have been strained ever since Trump took office. Trump's support for Britain's exit from the European Union, his disparaging attitude toward NATO allies and the principle of collective defense, his protectionist trade policies -- these and other aspects of ""America First"" have left Europeans disgruntled with and disaffected from the United States.   Then came Covid-19. After weeks of downplaying the virus, Trump in early March finally grew alarmed as the spread of the disease led to a plunge in the US. stock market. On March 11, Trump announced sweeping restrictions on travel from most of Europe -- without providing advance warning to his European counterparts. The European Union's co-presidents issued a response that did not hide their pique: ""The Coronavirus is a global crisis, not limited to any continent and it requires cooperation rather than unilateral action. The European Union disapproves of the fact that the U.S. decision to impose a travel ban was taken unilaterally and without consultation."" When the virus' dangerous potential became readily apparent in January, Trump should have immediately led an international effort to procure, allocate, and distribute needed medical equipment, to generate and share best practices on testing and isolation, and to advance the preparedness of lower income communities and countries that are likely to be particularly hard hit.   Instead, it was not until March 16 -- months too late -- that Trump participated in a video conference to discuss the pandemic with the leaders of the G7, a grouping of the world's leading democracies. The following week, G7 foreign ministers could not muster the solidarity to issue a joint statement -- reportedly because Secretary of State Mike Pompeo insisted on inserting the term ""Wuhan virus"" into the communique rather than using the standard ""coronavirus"" or ""Covid-19"" terminology. The US government, in the midst of an unprecedented worldwide health emergency, broke with its key allies for the sole purpose of fingering China. Pompeo may be so keen to score points against Beijing precisely because China so far has the upper hand when it comes to public perceptions of international efforts to handle the pandemic -- especially in Europe. Covid-19 has admittedly hit Beijing with a significant image problem. Wuhan was ground zero for the virus and the Chinese government initially suppressed information about its spread and severity.  But Beijing has already succeeded in putting forward a different face. The same week that Trump announced his travel restrictions on Europeans, the Chinese sent a planeload of medical supplies to Italy.  Thousands of Chinese masks, ventilators, and test kits have been arriving across Europe, in some cases accompanied by Chinese medics. Such assistance may be part of a Chinese charm offensive, but the bottom line is that China is stepping up for Europe at a time when the United States is nowhere to be found. ""We are not alone, there are people in the world who want to help Italy,"" remarked the Italian foreign minister, Luigi Di Maio, in response to the arrival of Chinese help.   China's medical assistance to Europe builds on Beijing's ongoing efforts to woo the continent through its Belt and Road Initiative, which entails massive Chinese investment in infrastructure and the construction of new trade linkages that span Eurasia. China already has financial stakes in over a dozen European ports, including major gateways in Greece and Italy. The allure of deeper ties to Asia's markets is pulling Europeans eastward.   The Chinese are waiting for Europe with open arms at the same time that the United States is pushing Europeans away from the close partnership with America that has served both sides of the Atlantic so well since the 1940s. Trump's bumbling response to the pandemic is only expediting this trend.   Europe's geopolitical realignment is still in its early stages and a definitive break with the United States is by no means foreordained. Europeans still look to the United States, not China, as their partner of choice. Indeed, they are hoping and praying that Trump is a one-term president, and that whoever comes next reclaims the mantle of international leadership and teamwork.   The outcome of the November election may well determine the fate of the transatlantic partnership. Even as they cope with a dire emergency at home, Americans should keep in mind that they need friends abroad. Otherwise, when this pandemic abates and Americans welcome the end of social distancing, they will nonetheless find the United States a very lonely country in the world. "
Humans are terrible at being apart. Here's why and what to do about it," (CNN)In Tokyo, crowds have been congregating in parks each day to see the cherry blossoms at peak bloom. Some 6,000 miles away in Washington DC, people were doing the exact same thing. Like so many people in so many countries, they are willfully ignoring government advice to stay at home and to keep well away from others, as the coronavirus spreads rapidly, killing thousands and already changing daily life as we know it. But is it really just the cherry blossoms, or the beaches in Australia and California, or parks in central London that have inspired throngs of people to leave their homes during a pandemic? It's plausible. There's little else to do as cities around the world have all but shut down. There is, however, something else highly appealing about going to these places, and it's the very thing that threatens to worsen the pandemic -- other people. It seems that we humans just can't stay away from one another. Even in Italy, the country with the most coronavirus cases and deaths in the world, 125,000 people have been fined for breaking rules on restriction of movement. Many of these violations were made by people trying to sneak away and meet with other people, Italian media reports.  The desire to be physically near others is human nature. We humans -- or our ancestor species, more precisely -- have been social creatures since the Stone Age. Many studies have shown that hunter-gatherers formed ""bands"" as they found it more efficient to find enough food for survival through joint efforts. They also found strength in numbers, fending off threats, whether animal or human, more effectively as a group. Over a long evolutionary process, humans have developed highly sophisticated societies in which we cooperate to survive and better our lives, studies show. Today, having consensual physical contact with other people and enjoying the company of others in in the flesh releases all sorts of chemicals in the brain and body -- endorphins, serotonin and oxytocin, for example -- that essentially give us feelings of happiness and even love.  This is why, when we go to a concert or a football match, it's not just the athletes or the musicians that give us that sense of euphoria. Being with a lot of other people adds to the kick.  ""Not everybody likes these situations, some people hate crowds. But for those that do, being with a lot of other people creates a physiological pleasure, endorphins, et cetera, go off,"" said Michael Muthukrishna, an assistant professor of Economic Psychology with the London School of Economics and Political Science. After events like this, people say they feel more bonded to one another and that they feel part of something whole, he told CNN.  ""It's a wonderful feeling to be part of a bigger thing. Cheering on your own isn't as good as cheering with a friend, and that's not as good as cheering in a large crowd chanting war cries. It physiologically creates a sense of the individual dissolving into the whole."" In these sophisticated societies we have developed, we rely heavily on one another to get by.  In hunter-gatherer days, one person or family may have been responsible for finding food, cooking it, building a home and making clothes. Now we rely on other people from all over the world, with their own sets of knowledge and skills, to carry out different functions essential to surviving, Muthukrishna explains.  ""Our society is such that we have a division of labor, and a more complex whole world than even the smartest among us could possibly understand. Each of us understands a small sliver of the world, and the rest is socially acquired,"" he said.  ""It's what we call the illusion of explanatory depths -- we assume we understand how the world works, but really we have a very poor understanding of most things. We're happy to trust in the people who do. For example, you believe in germs. You might have seen them under microscope, but really you believe in it because you trust people that know that germs exist, even though you don't actually have access to that information."" We also really like touching The coronavirus and need to physically distance ourselves has put much of our lives online. We have work meetings by video conference, we Skype with friends and family we can't meet, and we watch Netflix instead of going out for dinner.  But anyone who has had a long-distance relationship or has friends and family in far-flung places knows that Skype just isn't the same. Partly, it's because we really like to touch each other.  Giving someone a hug, handshake or a kiss releases those same chemicals in the brain and body that make us happy. This natural process develops right from the start of life -- touch is the first sense a baby develops in the womb. Newborns are able see very little and their hearing is murky for some time after birth, so skin-to-skin contact is highly recommended between parents and babies to build bonds.  There are all sorts of health benefits too. Skin-to-skin contact between mothers and babies regulates the baby's heart rate and breathing, stimulates digestion, helps fend off infection, stimulates the release of hormones to support breastfeeding and reduces cortisol, a stress hormone that suppresses the immune system, numerous studies show. The health benefits of human touch carry on through childhood, adolescence and adulthood, according to Tiffany Field, founder and director of the University of Miami's Touch Research Institute. Touch helps strengthens the immune system in fighting infections and plays a role in reducing mental health problems, Field has found in her research. People in the United States, as in many other countries, are becoming less and less tactile with each other, she said.   Field is concerned that human health is suffering as we increasingly isolate ourselves physically and become engrossed in communicating via technology. This ""touch starvation"" is evident in a growing industry of professional cuddlers, who offer safe spaces for people who need hugs and other forms of platonic touching. Field has carried out several studies that show that touch-deprived children and teenagers show higher levels of aggression. In one, she compared teenagers hanging out at a McDonald's in Paris with some at a McDonald's in Miami.  ""The kids in Paris, who were getting more touch and were touching each other more, were less physically and verbally aggressive toward each other,"" she told CNN.  Field is working on a new study observing people at airport gates, where she says there is a concerning lack of human contact. ""We're seeing that people are not touching each other. They're on their cell phones, which is a real problem. People are now used to not touching each other -- there's very little handshaking and hugging, there's very little touch going on,"" she said.  There are very few studies on humans for touch deprivation for ethical reasons, but the concept of human contact as a basic need developed in the 1950s and 1960s, when researcher Harry Harlow experimented with monkeys.  In a landmark study, he removed baby monkeys from their mothers and created wire-framed ""mother"" dummies. He consistently found that the monkeys deprived of touch showed serious behavioral problems. When given the choice, even when very hungry, the monkeys would choose a ""mother"" dummy covered in soft fabric to cuddle with over the plain wire-framed dummy offering milk.  Prisoners who have been kept in solitary confinement have often described a lack of physical human contact as torture. Chelsea Manning, for example, in 2016 wrote of what she called ""no-touch torture"" when kept in a cell alone for long periods of time.  Stay connected It seems particularly perverse that human contact is so beneficial to health and fighting disease, yet during this pandemic, human contact is literally our biggest threat. But experts agree the benefits of social distancing far outweigh the risk of socializing. So what can be done about it? Field is hoping that staying at home will actually mean more touching. Give your loved ones a back rub, Field suggests, and if you're living alone during this period, then touch yourself.  ""We know that moving the skin is critical for health reasons. Moving the skin puts the body into a more relaxed state. The vagal activity in the brain increases, and that slows the heart rate and lowers stress hormones, and that can even in the long run kill bacterial, viral and cancer cells,"" she said.  ""And someone giving a back rub will get just as much out of it as the recipient."" If you're living alone, do ""self massage,"" Field says.  ""Get a daily dose of it. You can reach most parts of your own body."" And on the social side, it's important to stay connected in non-physical ways, says Bianca Suanet, a sociologist from the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.  She said she was concerned about the impact of social distancing in the elderly, who may be more vulnerable to feelings of loneliness.  ""This period of social distancing is likely most difficult for older adults that lack a partner and a social support network that looks after them,"" said Suanet.  ""People that have a solid social support network might also miss face to face social contact, but if people have someone that gives them a call once in a while and can bring them groceries and other necessities if necessary, that solves already some of the problems,"" she said.  ""Helping others is one of the best ways to feel connected to other people."" "
Malaysian government apologizes after advising wives to avoid 'nagging' during coronavirus lockdown," (CNN)The Malaysian government was forced to apologize after its Women's Development Department published a series of sexist ""tips"" to help deal with the ongoing coronavirus lockdown, including advising women to continue to wear makeup and to ""avoid nagging.""While dressing up to work is one way of maintaining discipline and a routine while working from home, the focus on LOOKS, DRESS, and MAKEUP is absolutely unnecessary.Stop this sexist messaging @KPWKM and focus on #domesticviolence survivors who are at higher risk now! https://t.co/mU7nBqbkgk The campaign was met with fierce backlash online, and the posts have since been deleted from the department's social media account. As of Thursday afternoon in Malaysia, more than 2,900 coronavirus cases had been confirmed inside the country, killing 45 people, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University.  Prime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin enacted a series of far-reaching measures last month intended to stem infections of Covid-19, the disease caused by coronavirus, including strict nationwide controls locking down all travel in or out of the country and heavily restricting movement within the country. One of the biggest criticisms against the government body charged with supporting women appeared to be that it was ignoring concerns about a rise in domestic violence that may accompany stay-at-home orders, and instead focusing on things like how women should dress. The Malaysian All Women's Action Society called on the Women's Development Department to stop its sexist messaging and to focus on helping domestic violence survivors. Women's Development Department director-general Akhma Hassan said the aim was to send out positive messages, according to state-run news agency Bernama. ""The approach used was to share methods and practices to maintain positive relationships within the family and during the phase of working from home,"" she said in a statement.  ""We have taken note of numerous comments on some tips for women which were promoted through posters via our social media accounts. The Malaysian government and its leaders have faced accusations of sexism and misogyny on multiple occasions in recent years. During a debate on amending domestic violence laws in 2017, a member of parliament said husbands were ""abused"" when wives threw insults, withheld sex and denied consent for Muslim men to take another wife.

Women are using code words at pharmacies to escape domestic violence during lockdown," (CNN)On Sunday, a woman walked into a pharmacy in the French city of Nancy, one of the few public places still open after the government imposed a nationwide lockdown to prevent the spread of a dangerous virus. I moved to Paris during lockdownLove under lockdown: The couples pushed together and kept apart by coronavirusPeople in the West are ignoring advice to stay homeAir pollution drops as Europeans stay at homeThere has always been gender violence, but this crisis makes it all worse.""Simona AmmerataWe know the #lockdown will be an incredibly scary time if you're living with an abusive partner. Our chat bot can empower you so that, when you do leave the house, you're only sharing your location with those you want to.Click on the pink icon to start: https://t.co/MZZhTmbWV1 pic.twitter.com/cfjeGPVWlwCNN's Pierre-Eliott Buet, Fanny Bobille, Stephanie Halasz and Samantha Beech contributed reporting.  But the woman wasn't there for medicine; she was there to tell the pharmacist that her partner had abused her. Soon after, the woman's spouse was arrested by police. As the coronavirus pandemic forces countries everywhere to take unprecedented steps to restrict the movement of their citizens, victims of domestic violence have suddenly found themselves trapped at home with their abusive partners. Some are unable -- or too afraid -- to call the police, experts say.   So France, inspired by a similar scheme in Spain, has started telling victims to head to drugstores. If they can't talk openly in the store, they can simply say the codeword ""mask 19"" to the pharmacist behind the counter. The woman in Nancy was the first to seek help since the government launched the initiative last week, the spokesperson for Marlene Schiappa, the French minister for equality, told CNN. As lockdown measures across Europe get stricter, charities and police forces are raising the alarm over a potential spike in domestic violence. Being confined at home with their abuser makes victims more vulnerable, because there is no escape. On top of that, multiple studies have found that emotionally stressful events can lead to an increase in aggressive behavior at home. Researchers identified such spikes during the 2008 economic crisis, when major natural disasters hit, and also during big football tournaments. Christophe Castaner, the French Interior Minister, said there had been a 36% increase in police intervention for cases of domestic violence in Paris after the lockdown measures were enacted. The government has announced that it will pay for 20,000 nights in hotel rooms for victims of domestic violence and open pop-up counseling centers at supermarkets. There are worrying reports from other countries, too.  ""There has always been gender violence, but this crisis makes it all worse,"" Simona Ammerata, who works at the Lucha y Siesta women's shelter in Rome, Italy told CNN.  One young woman who contacted Lucha y Siesta recently said her partner of four years had always been controlling and abusive but had become much worse during the lockdown. ""The dynamic of violence in the house is getting very serious,"" said Ammerata. ""She asked him to leave and he doesn't want to. She says she has no places to go.""  The public health crisis has overwhelmed Italy and local authorities have been forced to redirect much of their resources to fighting the virus. ""The court procedures are working slower than usual because most people are working from home,"" Ammerata added. ""The fear is that the legal decrees to protect women won't be put in place in time."" And the problem isn't limited to Europe. In Australia, the government said that Google has registered the most searches for domestic violence help in the past five years during the outbreak, with an increase of 75%. The government has introduced an AUD $150 million ($92 million) package to support victims of domestic, family and sexual violence due to the fallout from coronavirus. Refuge, a leading British charity focused on fighting domestic violence, said one of the biggest concerns is that victims may find themselves unable to report their ordeal.  ""We know that ordinarily the window of opportunity for women with abusive partners to make a call and seek help is often very limited,"" said Sandra Horley, Refuge's chief executive. ""Now, it is likely that window has become even smaller,"" she added. Refuge is advising women to use the ""Silent Solution"" emergency call, which allows people to reach the police using touch phone without the need to speak. It has also put in place a chatbot.  The Telefono Rosa domestic violence helpline in Italy said it received 55% fewer calls in the first two weeks of March because many women found it difficult to ask for help during the lockdown. It said many women are ""whispering to avoid being heard by their partner in the room next-door."" Delphine Beauvais, the director of a women's shelter network Rosa in the north of France, told CNN the organization is experiencing a similar drop in calls: ""We believe this could be due to women's inability to reach out to us as a consequence of confinement."" Ammerata has had a similar experience. Victims have been reaching out during their brief trips to supermarkets or sending messages while taking showers. She said the strict rules are making it difficult for vulnerable women to escape their abusive relationships.  ""In a normal situation, leaving the house and the abuser is already hard,"" she said. ""Today, this has quadrupled, because you can't go to your friends or family because the government decree says you can't go ... leaving now is very, very hard. Harder than ever."" "
FBI sees spike in gun sale background checks amid coronavirus pandemic," (CNN)The FBI reported a 41% surge in background checks by individuals attempting to purchase firearms in the United States last month, according to newly released data from the agency, a significant increase over the same period last year.CNN's Michael Nedelman, Jose Pagliery, and Aaron Smith contributed to this story. The new figures indicate 3.7 million gun purchase background checks were conducted in the month of March alone, marking the greatest number of background checks conducted in a single month since the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) was launched in 1998. By far, the state leading in federal firearm background checks numbers for the month of March was Illinois -- with over half a million background checks conducted -- followed by Texas, Kentucky, Florida, and California.  Under US law, federally licensed gun dealers must run checks on every buyer, whether a purchase is made in a store or at a gun show. A buyer presents his or her identification to the seller and fills out a form from the US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF), which lists the buyer's age, address, race, and any criminal history. The seller then submits the information to the FBI and the agency checks the applicant's info against databases in order to ensure a criminal record does not preclude the purchase. The dramatic rise in attempted firearm purchases in the US comes as the nation grapples with the spread of the deadly coronavirus. In mid-March, President Donald Trump announced sweeping new guidelines, including a recommendation that Americans stay home and avoid public gatherings and discretionary travel.  As new stay-at-home orders have been issued by states and municipalities across the country, experts have indicated a byproduct of these measures aimed at stopping the spread of the virus can include fear and anxiety.  ""We often see seasonal spikes in firearm sales, but, in addition, it is not uncommon to see increased gun sales based on political or social events and attitudes,"" said ATF spokesperson Cara Herman. ""Background checks and other regulatory safeguards are in place to ensure that only those eligible under federal law can obtain and possess firearms."" FBI statistics show the number of background checks it conducts nationwide has steadily increased since the system began over two decades ago. Gun purchases have also historically jumped following incidents of national tragedy -- an occurrence some experts attribute to the need to feel safe.  ""The rise in gun and ammunition sales during this crisis is understandable as the fear of the unknown can drive purchasing far off their norms,"" said Jonathan Wackrow, CNN Law Enforcement Analyst and former special agent with the US Secret Service. ""Research has shown that during a crisis, if individuals let fear, anxiety, and confusion spread, they will most likely begin to feel helpless. For many, the purchase of a weapon resolves that sense of helplessness."" A spokesperson for the National Rifle Association, one of the nation's largest gun-rights organizations, suggested that concerns about personal safety during the coronavirus pandemic are likely key drivers in the surge of FBI background checks.  ""Firearm sales go up in times of uncertainty because Americans know their safety is ultimately in their own hands,"" said NRA spokesperson Amy Hunter. ""Headlines remind us about prisoners being furloughed, first responders being told to selectively enforce laws or being minutes away when seconds count. Now, more than ever, it's important that families have the ability and the tools they need to feel safe and able to defend themselves."" By contrast, advocacy groups in favor of stricter gun control are sounding the alarm over increased gun sales during what many view as a time of unprecedented national fear and anxiety. ""Adding more guns into the mix during a deadly pandemic won't make anyone safer, but it will make the gun lobby richer,"" said Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action. ""This spike in gun sales is deeply concerning, particularly for the millions of children unexpectedly at home with unsecured guns, women sheltering in place with abusers, and anyone struggling economically and psychologically."" The issues raised by Watts were echoed by others formerly in law enforcement, who view the surge in firearms as an unnecessary addition to an already volatile situation.  ""My biggest concern involves the potential number of first time gun buyers who, before March, did not think they needed a gun,"" said David Chipman, a retired ATF special agent and senior policy adviser to the Giffords organization countering gun violence. ""Now in a moment of panic they are rushing to a store and buying a lethal weapon they don't know how to use and don't know how to store safely. Unfortunately, thousands of Americans have placed their families in jeopardy at a time when they simply want to be safe."" "
"As tragic toll from virus rises, so do questions about Trump's leadership"," (CNN)President Donald Trump's White House appears powerless to halt an increasingly tragic trajectory in the coronavirus pandemic as the death toll climbed by nearly 1,000 on a single, dark day. Vice President Mike Pence warned in a CNN interview that the most comparable example for what is to come is Italy, which has endured weeks of misery as the previous epicenter of the global crisis. For all the formidable power of the White House, Trump and his top officials can do little more to urge Americans to stay home to ease the terrible demands being placed on medical staff in hospitals in worst-hit areas that are crammed with sick patients and running out of basic supplies. There is a feeling of a terrible storm approaching with the government predicting the worst over the next month or so. ""It's still heartbreaking when we think about the lives that could be lost -- and so our message yesterday, our message over the next 30 days, is the future is in our hands,"" Pence told CNN. The vice president was speaking after the administration Tuesday warned that between 100,000 and 240,000 Americans could die from the virus -- even if mitigation efforts, like stay-at-home orders now affecting 9 in 10 Americans, are properly observed. The deepening sense of foreboding is focusing debate on whether Trump -- who spent weeks downplaying the likely impact of the pandemic -- had cost lives by not being more proactive. Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told CNN's Jake Tapper Sunday that Trump's ""denial at the beginning was deadly,"" saying that as the President ""fiddles, people are dying."" Then there were calls Wednesday for the President to mandate a nationwide shutdown with some states still dragging their feet, even as Johns Hopkins University reported 216,515 confirmed cases in the US and 5,119 deaths as of midnight Wednesday -- figures that show that nowhere in the country is likely to be immune. Adding to the evidence that the federal government is falling short, officials confirmed that a national stockpile of ventilators and protective medical gear, desperately needed by frontline health workers, is all but exhausted. Trump has moved from denying the severity of the pandemic and agitating to open the economy to a recognition of how bad things could get. ""America continues to wage all-out war to defeat the virus -- this horrible, horrible virus,"" Trump said Wednesday. The President has extended nationwide self-distancing guidelines until April 30. But after an unusually somber appearance in the briefing room on Tuesday, the President was back to his habitual efforts to distract from any personal culpability for the situation. He didn't even want to start his regular dinner time appearance before reporters by talking about the virus, on the deadliest day yet for Americans. Instead he highlighted a new anti-narcotics initiative in a fresh example of how he has often sought to turn coronavirus briefings into the political platform he lacks with campaign rallies canceled. Bizarrely, the President also boasted about his popularity on Facebook, and suddenly floated a scheme to build two new hospital ships -- a project that would take years in the event the Navy commissions them. And Trump and Pence dodged on tough questions about the crisis -- for instance, on loopholes in Florida's belated stay-at-home directives finally imposed by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Trump ally. After Pence waffled on a query over whether Obamacare exchanges could be opened up to help Americans who lost insurance along with their jobs when the economy was shut down, Trump poured praise on his vice president. ""That was one of the greatest answers I've ever heard, because Mike was able to talk for five minutes and not answer your question,"" Trump told a reporter. His performance appeared to confirm the skepticism of critics who saw his much hailed change of previous tone about the scope of the virus as a temporary departure from his unchained norm. New questions about Trump's responsibility As the crisis gets worse, with the federal government now predicting between 100,000 and 240,000 Americans could die, even if self-distancing works, the question over whether the death toll could have been eased with an earlier White House response are becoming ever more acute. The White House claims that Trump's leadership has been all but perfect, despite his downplaying of the virus and failure to order a huge preparation effort when it took hold in China. But a Trump adviser working with the task force told CNN's Jim Acosta that Trump bet that warmer weather in the spring would cause the virus to dissipate. ""He took a gamble and got it wrong,"" the adviser said. ""He analyzed the data and opinions of experts and sided with the one that said warm weather will likely slow the virus."" Such a decision could turn out to be one of the most fateful moments of the US response to the pandemic. The indications of how Trump handled the approaching storm will fuel claims by Democrats that he cost lives by not acting more quickly. The President also tried to deflect blame on Wednesday, insisting no one could have predicted that the US could be struck by a disease that would spread like wildfire among the population. ""This is so contagious. Nobody's ever seen anything like this, where large groups of people all of a sudden, just by being in the presence of somebody, have it,"" he said in the briefing. That argument was untrue. As China faced a rising challenge from the virus and quarantined the city of Wuhan, the virulence of the pandemic was obvious and could be gleaned from news sources. At the end of February, a senior Centers for Disease Control and Prevention official, Nancy Messonnier, warned publicly that ""disruption to everyday life may be severe."" Trump also confirmed Wednesday that the government was nearing the end of its stocks of items like protective personal equipment and ventilators. Officials said that the stockpile was never meant to be the sole source of supply for items like protective equipment and that local authorities should seek to fill their need on the open market. That will come as terrible news to state governors and frontline health care workers who are pleading for more equipment -- and for Trump to fully unleash the power of government to surge manufacturing of such items. Republicans blame impeachment for virus response delays The scale of the looming disaster would have tested any administration and was bound to highlight flaws in governance at the local and state level as well. But Trump is being criticized so vehemently because he was so vocal in dismissing the threat from the virus for weeks. It also took him a prolonged period to fully embrace the warnings of his scientific advisers on the need for national self-distancing measures. As the continuing inadequacy of the federal government effort becomes clear, a coordinated effort by the White House and Republican allies to redirect blame is under way. On CNN on Wednesday, Pence pointed the finger at the CDC and Beijing. ""I will be very candid with you and say that in mid-January the CDC was still assessing that the risk of the coronavirus to the American people was low,"" Pence said. ""The very first case, which was someone who had been in China -- in late January around the 20th day of January,"" Pence told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. ""The reality is that we could've been better off if China had been more forthcoming."" There are serious questions about China's cooperating in sharing data about the specifics of the virus. But anyone watching the news could have concluded the new respiratory disease sooner or later was likely to arrive on US shores. In fact, Miami Mayor Francis Suarez told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Wednesday that his fire chief made such an evaluation on Super Bowl weekend -- February 1 and 2 -- and ordered protective equipment for his crews, who are as a result now well stocked. Senate Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell opened another front in the effort to deflect criticism from the President on Tuesday, saying that the impeachment saga had distracted Washington from the looming threat of the virus. His spin was enthusiastically taken up by Republican senators. ""I think there's no question it was a huge distraction,"" Missouri Sen. Roy Blunt told Hugh Hewitt on his radio show Wednesday. ""Now it doesn't mean we weren't paying any attention to what was happening in China or other places, but there's no doubt it was a huge distraction."" On the same show, Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz said there was ""zero interest manifested by either (House Speaker) Nancy Pelosi and (Senate Democratic Minority Leader) Chuck Schumer in the coronavirus outbreak, in anything problematic occurring in China and the Chinese Communist government's coverup of the coronavirus outbreak."" Such arguments ignore the primary responsibility of the executive in keeping Americans safe. A future investigation will for sure probe whether Washington as a whole took the investigation sufficiently seriously and may find that Congress was asleep at the switch. But the impeachment argument is questionable for several reasons. First, the most visible public official dismissing the seriousness of the coronavirus threat was the President himself. And Trump was acquitted on charges of abusing power and obstructing Congress after a Senate trial on February 5. On January 26, Schumer, the top Senate Democrat, called on the administration to declare a public health emergency over coronavirus to free up funding. "
The 'game changer' that wasn't: Company falsely claimed FDA authorization for coronavirus blood test," (CNN)The company claimed it would distribute the first coronavirus antibody test authorized by the US Food and Drug Administration. It promised to detect current and past infections in as little as two minutes -- with just a tiny amount of blood.Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.CNN's Michael Nedelman contributed to this report. ""This is a game changer,"" said the company, Bodysphere, in a statement on Tuesday. It promised to deliver millions of test kits within weeks. Multiple news outlets reported the announcement. The company's website, with the words ""MADE IN USA"" beneath a slick logo, showcased photos of the test, including the FDA logo plastered on its box. And in a tweet on Monday, Bodysphere said: ""It is not the first time we will play a major role in changing the world."" But the company's claims of an FDA-authorized coronavirus antibody test have been explicitly refuted by the FDA. Bodysphere said Tuesday that the serology test had received what is known as an Emergency Use Authorization from the FDA. Serology is another word for the study of blood, and the company claimed the test could detect antibodies with a process as simple as a glucose test. But Michael Felberbaum, an FDA spokesperson, told CNN later that day: ""No serology tests have received an authorization to test for coronavirus."" D'Anne Mica, a Bodysphere spokesperson, maintained to CNN throughout the day on Tuesday that the company had received authorization for the test, despite the FDA's statement. But on Wednesday, Mica said ""there was a misunderstanding"" and acknowledged that the FDA never issued the emergency authorization.  In a statement that night, the company's CEO, Charlton Lui, said his company ""mistakenly believed"" it had received the authorization ""in the rush"" to deliver tests, blaming a misunderstanding of paperwork. Also on Wednesday, two of the news organizations that reported on Bodysphere -- Reuters and Axios -- retracted their articles. The damage, it seems, had already been done: Following the company's false claims, people scrambled to access the tests. ""It crashed the phone line,"" said Mica when asked how many orders the company had received. Mica said that ""people desperate to get their hands on these test kits"" had been calling her, even though she is a media representative. ""It's just been blowing my mind."" She said she had received messages from people clamoring for tests: ""Mothers from North Carolina just wanting to get their kids tested because they've had all of the symptoms. Somebody called me from Tampa."" A foreign embassy had even called four times, she said. A different antibody test has now been authorized ""HUMANITY GOES HIGH-TECH,"" Bodysphere says on its website, which also lists N95 masks, sanitizing gel and hospital beds. The site, which features photos of lions and an astronaut, says that Bodysphere has ""Alchemy Laboratories"" and is involved in the creation of ""Hemp Bio Plastics."" The company's most prominent product, though, is its rapid serology test. Such tests are able to look for antibodies against the coronavirus -- a sign of recent or past infection even if somebody never showed severe symptoms. The FDA has cautioned that serology tests ""should not be used as the sole basis to diagnose or exclude [coronavirus] infection or to inform infection status."" But in an Emergency Use Authorization dated Wednesday, the FDA green-lit an antibody test from a different manufacturer, Cellex Inc. The FDA told the company ""it is reasonable to believe that your product may be effective in diagnosing COVID-19,"" adding that the test's benefits outweighed its risks. The Cellex test, then, became the first antibody test authorized by the FDA. Beyond diagnosing the virus, serology tests may be useful for research, such as determining what percentage of the population has ever been infected, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That would allow researchers to understand how widespread coronavirus infections truly are, including asymptomatic or mild cases. But only the one antibody test, from Cellex, has been explicitly authorized by the FDA as of Thursday.   On Wednesday, the FDA logo had disappeared from photos of the test on Bodysphere's website. A downloadable catalog from the company, however, still showed the FDA logo above the test. A variety of other products in the catalog, including hospital beds and face shields, featured the FDA logo as well. ""The FDA logo is for the official use of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and not for use on private sector materials,"" the FDA says on its website. ""To the public, such use would send a message that FDA favors or endorses a private sector organization or the organization's activities, products, services, and/or personnel (either overtly or tacitly), which FDA does not and cannot do."" FDA authorization would have signaled confidence in the test The FDA, under rules issued last month, allows companies to make and distribute serology tests that haven't received authorization. But according to Felberbaum, the FDA spokesperson, those companies are required to include something along the lines of: ""This test has not been reviewed by the FDA."" That's important, because antibodies -- which serology tests look for -- are our body's response to an infection and can take time to develop. That means these blood tests may not be able to identify recent infections. Most coronavirus tests, in contrast, generally require a patient to be swabbed. The test then looks for the virus's genetic information, and should be able to detect whenever somebody is shedding the virus. Bodysphere said in its press release that the blood test ""has not been FDA cleared or approved,"" but the company falsely claimed the test had ""been authorized by the FDA under an Emergency Use Authorization for use by authorized laboratories and patient care settings."" Full FDA approval is an extensive process that no coronavirus test has yet achieved. But an Emergency Use Authorization from the agency would have been a sign that regulators believed the benefits of using a quickly designed blood test outweighed the risks, such as the possibility of false positives or negatives. In its press release, Bodysphere said the two-minute serological coronavirus test had 91% specificity, meaning that 9% of people could falsely test positive for the virus without being infected. Not made in the USA, despite the company's claims Mica, the Bodysphere spokesperson, told CNN on Tuesday that it would take time to send documentation for the test because the company making the tests was based in China. ""[Bodysphere] is the authorized distributor, the US distributor,"" Mica said. ""The kits are coming from China, so, they're not coming from China, but the company is, everything, you know, is manufactured in China right now,"" she said. In a call Wednesday, after acknowledging that the FDA had not issued an emergency authorization for Bodysphere's test, Mica confirmed that the test is not in any way designed or manufactured in the United States. The company's website still suggests that its products are US-made, however. Beneath the company's logo, for example, are the words ""MADE IN USA."" And a page on the company's catalog blares ""Proudly American"" in cursive. While Mica said Bodysphere had already received numerous requests for its test, the company admitted publicly on Wednesday that it had not received the authorization it had originally claimed. In a Twitter reply to a skeptical observer, the company said, ""you seem to be in a combat to prove that our company is not trustable. ""We applied for FDA as well,"" the company added, but ""the process takes time. And the virus does not wait."" "
"Ellis Marsalis Jr., pianist, educator and patriarch of legendary musical family, dies of complications from coronavirus"," (CNN)Ellis Marsalis Jr., a New Orleans jazz legend, educator and father of four musical sons died on Wednesday, Ellis Marsalis Center for Music Director Emeritus Quint Davis told CNN. He was 85. The cause of death was complications of Covid-19, his son Branford  Marsalis told the New York Times. ""Ellis Marsalis was a legend. He was the prototype of what we mean when we talk about New Orleans jazz,"" New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell said in a statement Wednesday night. ""He was a teacher, a father, and an icon -- and words aren't sufficient to describe the art, the joy and the wonder he showed the world."" Four of Marsalis' six sons followed in his musical footsteps, and established their own lasting careers in the industry. His son Wynton is managing and artistic director of Jazz at Lincoln Center, and winner of multiple awards. His son Branford is a jazz saxophonist who has recorded albums with Sting, among others. In addition to his own storied career as a jazz pianist and composer, Ellis Marsalis was also the first jazz instructor at the New Orleans Center for the Creative Arts, and the first chair of the jazz studies program at the University of New Orleans, according to Cantrell's statement.

Nation's top coronavirus expert Dr. Anthony Fauci forced to beef up security as death threats increase," (CNN)Dr. Anthony Fauci, the country's top medical expert on the coronavirus pandemic and a member of President Donald Trump's coronavirus task force, is facing threats to his personal safety and now requires personal security from law enforcement at all times, including at his home, a source confirms to CNN.   A law enforcement official told CNN that the Department of Health and Human Services Inspector General, the agency's law enforcement arm, asked the US Marshals Service for assistance following threats to Fauci. The Marshals then deputized HHS officers to act as personal security for the doctor.   The Washington Post first reported the threats to Fauci and the increased security. A source also confirmed to CNN last week the presence of several members of the Washington, DC, Metropolitan Police Department stationed at all times around Fauci's home in the district. The source added the stepped up visible police presence was a response to growing threats to Fauci's safety, though the source of the threats was not identified. During the White House coronavirus task force briefing with reporters on Wednesday, Fauci was asked whether he or White House coronavirus response coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx, who also serves on the task force, had received threats of any kind or whether they had been assigned a security detail. He said he was not able to answer.  ""Anything that has to do with security detail I would have to have you (ask your question) to the inspector general of HHS,"" he said, referencing the Department of Health and Human Services. Fauci's response was quickly interrupted by Trump, who stepped up to the podium to say the nation's most visible infectious disease expert doesn't require protection. ""(He) doesn't need security, everybody loves them,"" said Trump. ""Besides that, they'd be in big trouble if they ever attacked."" However, as Fauci's profile in the pandemic crisis has grown, so has the concern for his welfare. Fauci's guidance to Trump for the country to remain as locked down as possible to help control the virus spread has not earned fans among some fervent right-wing voices.  Fauci was among the health advisers on Trump's team encouraging a continuation of the current guidelines after the President heard from business leaders and some conservative allies that the restrictions were more damaging than the virus itself. In fact, Trump's decision to extend those guidelines came after Fauci and Birx gave a strong presentation with the new models that showed 100,000 to 200,000 people could die, a source familiar with the President's decision told CNN.  ""You don't make the timeline, the virus makes the timeline,"" Fauci told CNN last month when asked about how long the novel coronavirus could affect daily life in the US. ""You may see in a relatively shorter period of time, when you're seeing the inkling of the flattening and coming down,"" he said in reference to slowing the speed of the outbreak. ""But you know, you can't make an arbitrary decision until you see what you're dealing with. You need the data."" "
Social Security recipients will automatically receive stimulus pay,"Washington (CNN)The Treasury Department, clearing up confusion, has announced Social Security recipients will not have to file a tax return in order to receive the economic stimulus payments the government is preparing to send out amid the coronavirus pandemic.  It was unclear in guidance posted earlier this week whether Social Security recipients who don't normally file taxes would have to in order to receive the money. But the Treasury Department said Wednesday that those beneficiaries will automatically receive the money. The IRS will use the information that the Social Security Administration has on file. Social Security recipients won't have to take any action.  Those who normally receive their benefits directly in their bank account will receive the stimulus money in the same way. Others will receive a check in the mail -- though it will likely take longer to receive the payment than those who use direct deposit.   The change came after Democratic lawmakers sent a letter Wednesday urging the Treasury Department to send the payments automatically to Social Security recipients -- something the law gives the IRS the power to do. Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri also criticized the IRS guidance, calling it ""ridiculous"" and saying the ""IRS should follow the law that Congress passed."" A $2 trillion stimulus bill signed by President Donald Trump last week includes money for the direct payments. Individuals are due up to $1,200 and couples will receive up to $2,400 -- plus $500 per child. Updated guidance posted Wednesday said that Social Security recipients who don't file tax returns would not receive additional money for children at this time because the IRS won't have information on dependents.  But payments start phasing out for individuals with adjusted gross incomes of more than $75,000. The amount will then be reduced by $5 for every additional $100 of adjusted gross income, and those making more than $99,000 will not receive anything. The income thresholds would be doubled for couples. Generally, the income will be based on either your 2019 tax return -- if you've already filed it -- or your 2018 return. The IRS says that payments will go out automatically to those who authorized a direct deposit for their refunds, within three weeks. Others may receive a check in the mail or may be able to enter their direct deposit information online -- but there is little information about how that might work. The Treasury is planning to develop a ""web-based portal"" in the coming weeks.  "
Fact check: Trump again misleads on ventilator shortages and coronavirus timeline at off-topic briefing,"Washington (CNN)President Donald Trump made another series of false, misleading or dubious claims at a Wednesday coronavirus briefing that began with an off-topic discussion of his administration's efforts to fight drug trafficking.  Trump again said that ""nobody"" could have foreseen a pandemic crisis leading to a shortage of ventilators, for which there were numerous warnings. He predicted that the virus would no longer be a concern after about a month, a timeline at odds with assessments of experts. And he implied some states are basically fine when it comes to the coronavirus.  Here's a fact check of some of those claims: Timeline for the virus Trump said, ""After a month or so, I think once this passes, we're not going to have to be, hopefully, worried too much about the virus.""  Facts First: Trump's suggestion that the virus will ""pass"" in about a month is at odds with numerous expert assessments and his own recent statements. Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, has pointed in the last week to a model designed by the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. The model projects that the number of US deaths from the coronavirus will peak in mid- to late April. But it also projects that there will be more than 1,000 deaths per day every day from May 1 (a month from today) through May 10, then more than 200 deaths per day every day from May 11 through June 1.  The model projects the number of deaths dropping to zero in mid-July, three and a half months from today. (The model offers a range of estimates for each date.) Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said March 19 that she can't say ""for sure"" how long the crisis would last but some places would likely be impacted into ""the summer.""  And experts say there might well be a second wave of the virus to worry about even after the current crisis ends. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Monday that he would expect a second wave in the fall, ""because of the degree of transmissibility.""  He added that the US would be more prepared to test for and contain the virus at that time, but he did not say Americans would no longer have to worry about the virus after a month or so.  Trump himself acknowledged two weeks ago that people were warning that the virus could persist until ""July, August, something like that."" And though projections can change quickly, the President offered a timeline longer than ""a month or so"" this week. On Sunday, he said, ""We can expect that, by June 1st, we will be well on our way to recovery.""  (He then called the June 1 date ""aspirational,"" then said it was ""modified aspirational, because I think we're going to hit it. And maybe we'll even beat it."") Ventilator shortages Trump on Wednesday repeated the debunked claim that ""nobody"" predicted the shortages of ventilators that have become a major part of the coronavirus crisis in the US.  He made the comment while touting the efforts by US companies like Ford and General Motors to produce ventilators on an emergency basis.  ""We're building thousands of ventilators right now,"" Trump said at a White House press briefing. ""It takes a period of time to build them, and again nobody could have known a thing like this could happen."" Facts First: Trump is wrong. Medical experts and public health officials have said for years that the US would face a shortage of ventilators if there were ever a pandemic like Covid-19. Even during Trump's presidency, there had been warnings that hospitals would run out of lifesaving equipment and resources would be strained because the US wasn't prepared for a pandemic. Trump has repeatedly made claims like these in recent weeks, as the ventilator shortage became a full-blown crisis in places like New York City, where the outbreak is especially severe. Trump once even falsely claimed that ""nobody in their wildest dreams"" had predicted a ventilator shortage.  CNN previously reported that this warning was in at least 10 government reports between 2003 and 2015, raising the alarm that there wouldn't be breathing machines and other lifesaving equipment if the US were hit by a serious pandemic. The studies came from the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Government Accountability Office, the Obama White House and more.  For example: A study released in April 2015 by the NIH and CDC estimated that the US would likely need as many as 60,000 additional ventilators to deal with a severe flu pandemic scenario. Those additional machines could save 35,000 to 306,000 American lives, depending on the percentage of people who get sick, the report said. The President's comments about the ventilator shortages fit into his pattern of trying to avoid responsibility by falsely claiming that nobody ever predicted a pandemic like Covid-19. He has repeated that claim many times in the past two months, even though it has been repeatedly debunked. The number of coronavirus cases in each state Asked why he didn't issue a universal stay-at-home order for the entirety of the country, Trump implied that some states are basically fine when it comes to the coronavirus.  ""There are some states that don't have much of a problem,"" he said. ""There are some, well, they don't have the problem. They don't have thousands of people that are positive or thousands of people that even think they might have it, or hundreds of people in some cases."" Facts First: The entire country has been impacted by the coronavirus. Americans have tested positive in every US state and all but one territory. As of the start of Wednesday's press briefing, all 50 states had at least 100 cases. "
US freezes shipments of protective gear overseas - CNN," (CNN)The Trump administration will no longer ship personal protective equipment to allies overseas as the United States grapples with critical shortages of supplies and coronavirus cases continue to soar. A congressional source told CNN on Wednesday that they were informed late last Friday night that the coronavirus task force -- led by Vice President Mike Pence -- was stopping overseas shipments of the medical equipment and instead asking that the supplies be distributed within the United States. Asked about reports of the freeze on Wednesday, President Donald Trump said there was ""no truth whatsoever"" to them. However, minutes later, he noted that ""whatever we have, whatever we've committed to, we commit,"" but added that ""we also need a lot for ourselves."" ""Obviously, we're not going to be shipping too much,"" he said during a White House briefing.  Politico was the first to report on the freeze. CNN has reached out to the US Agency for International Development for comment.  The move comes as the US has turned to countries around the world with requests to donate or sell supplies ranging from hand sanitizer to ventilators in an effort to combat the deadly pandemic. In a list obtained by CNN, the State Department laid out 25 items for diplomats to request of their host countries.  South Korea said last week that Trump had made a personal appeal for supplies to President Moon Jae-in. On Wednesday, a Russian cargo plane stocked with medical supplies landed in New York, just days after Trump and President Vladimir Putin had spoken by phone. On Monday, USAID issued ""an urgent request"" to organizations for personal protective equipment and medical supplies, including test kits, masks and ventilators, that may be ""potentially available for use,"" according to an email obtained by CNN.   Despite the decision to freeze shipments of medical equipment overseas, the State Department and USAID have publicly touted America's generosity amid the global pandemic. ""In early February -- it seems like a long time ago -- in early February, we transported nearly 18 tons of medical supplies provided by Samaritan's Purse, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and others to Wuhan,"" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Tuesday, an apparent response to criticism of that shipment of aid. ""In America, we provide aid because we're a generous and noble people,"" he said. Last week, the State Department announced $274 million in health and humanitarian assistance in response to the pandemic. However, a senior State Department official acknowledged last week that they were not offering personal protective equipment as part of that assistance. A State Department spokesperson noted that, ""in general, we work to ensure short-supplied, critical medical supplies are not diverted from domestic need."" "

The coronavirus pandemic is an opportunity for organized crime in Asia,"Jeremy Douglas is the Regional Representative of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) in Southeast Asia and the Pacific. He can be followed on Twitter @jdouglasSEA. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. View more opinion articles on CNN. (CNN)To say the global novel coronavirus pandemic is causing chaos and affecting lives in real and tangible ways is certainly no understatement.  But one impact that has not received significant attention is how its spread is hurting the efforts of governments to combat transnational organized crime and trafficking -- especially in Asia, where the outbreak began. The virus and the strong measures required to combat its spread are challenging the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime's (UNODC) ability to bring Asia's law enforcement and justice authorities together to share information and intelligence, and to plan and conduct joint operations.  Though the movement of people and goods across borders has slowed, international and cross-border cooperation is more necessary than ever given the presence of multi-billion dollar trafficking syndicates in the region. Practical effects Behind the scenes, Covid-19 has impacted how many governments and the United Nations run on a day-to-day basis, in ways not all appreciate and many are yet to understand.   The six governments of the Mekong -- Cambodia, China, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam -- and the UNODC have just had to suspend a long-planned and carefully negotiated joint operation against organized crime and drug traffickers at and along border hotspots of the region.  All face-to-face meetings of intelligence officials have been postponed until further notice, and with the trajectory of the outbreak it may be months before they meet again.  Public security ministers and senior officials are also essentially in lockdown and unsure of what to do next. Increased screenings At the same time, many frontline police, border and customs officials are now being tasked with screening people crossing borders for signs of the virus. Very problematically, many have received mixed signals about what they should be doing and how to do. The paramilitarized police of Asia operating at key border checkpoints have not been properly trained to take on a pandemic. And re-prioritizing the focus of largely ill-equipped and poorly trained law enforcement across the region to the pandemic could also hamper other priorities and undermine an already fragile rule of law, including important efforts to take on syndicates.  It is more than likely that traffickers will benefit in significant and tangible ways. Distraction The fact is that organized crime behavior is predictable, and traffickers will take advantage to smuggle precursors and produce and ship more drugs or other illicit goods while law enforcement is distracted and looking the other way. They will move quickly and decisively to capitalize. They will not hesitate -- their business is fundamentally built around capitalizing on governance dysfunction and vulnerabilities. In short, the pandemic is a disaster for ill-prepared law enforcement now struggling to respond, and it is an opportunity for organized crime in Asia. The coronavirus is exposing fatal flaws in public security capacity and response, and the region is likely to suffer as a result. When the situation settles down and the region gets a handle on the outbreak, the countries of the Mekong, Asia and the UN will need to quickly take stock and restart efforts to cooperate and collaborate, dusting off delayed plans and getting operations back on track.  If they do not, they risk losing further ground to transnational organized crime and traffickers -- something the region cannot afford. "
Trump's Covid-19 reelection strategy,"Joe Lockhart was White House press secretary from 1998-2000 in President Bill Clinton's administration. He co-hosts the podcast ""Words Matter."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN. (CNN)President Donald Trump has received considerable criticism from many quarters -- governors, public health officials and doctors and nurses on the frontline -- for being unprepared for the coronavirus pandemic, and for not having a national plan to deal with it.  Much of that criticism is well deserved.Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook What is clear looking over the last two months is that the president and his team have had a sophisticated political strategy to deal with the fast spreading pandemic. That strategy began in January, where at every turn the president downplayed the risks of the virus spreading in the United States. In interview after interview, and speech after speech, he assured Americans we were OK and any risk to the country was contained.  President Trump pointed to the shutting down of some flights from China, and one of his aides recently inaccurately said that Trump was the first to do it. North Korea closed its borders on January 22, and Italy banned flights from China to Italy staring January 31.    The president's strategy was that if the US could avoid the pandemic, despite all the loud calls for more action, he would be seen as the wise leader who didn't overreact and didn't kill our economy.  In an ironic twist, he co-opted former President Barack Obama's mantra of hope as a strategy.  But I believe Trump had a fallback plan in case the deadly virus hit us hard and he had a political plan ready to deploy. When the virus did erupt here, the president justified his earlier comments as an attempt to keep Americans calm. He also began shifting the blame in many different directions. One of his first targets was the Obama administration, which he claimed had left him with an obsolete system not fit for a 2020 pandemic.  That criticism ignored the fact that Trump had already been in office for three years and had done nothing to remedy the purported deficiencies.  The blame game continued and shifted to China. The president renamed Covid-19 the ""China virus,"" and the secretary of state held up diplomatic communiques at the G-7 and the United Nations because other countries wouldn't join in the race-baiting name of the ""Wuhan virus."" The president ultimately backtracked; I suspect in part because he realized Asian-Americans in swing states vote, and this strategy was politically counterproductive.  On Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had another theory on the slow response: impeachment distracted everyone from the virus, which echoed Trump blaming House Speaker Nancy Pelosi earlier this week for his being distracted by impeachment.  All of this is belied by the fact that the president, who got his first briefing about the risk to the United States in January, according to the Washington Post, found plenty of time to play golf between that briefing and the calls for social distancing. The important and lasting blame game moved to governors, and not just any governors. The president directed his criticism toward governors of big, blue states, most that he has little chance of winning in the 2020 election. So far, much of the intense outbreaks of the virus have occurred in blue states, which have much higher population density.    But the president made it seem that the main responsibility for any response to the pandemic was left to the governors, and he learned very early on to either ignore or deny their pleas for help.  He criticized them personally for failing to be prepared. On Monday, during a conference call, Trump told Montana Gov. Steve Bullock that -- despite enormous evidence -- he hadn't heard of any problems with the testing regime.   During Friday's White House briefing, Trump foreshadowed his strategy by praising the work of Florida's Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, who sought to keep New Yorkers from coming to Florida.   That same governor refused to shut down the state's beaches, essentially opening Florida's arms to spring breakers. Blaming the blue state governors has a phase two also. As the virus spreads to the less densely populated states that are mostly red, the president is poised to blame the blue state governors for not doing enough to stop the spread of the virus. Thus, deflecting blame for the lack of a national response and setting up an important talking point for the fall. His most insidious blame game tactic came over the weekend when he implied that New York frontline responders -- docs, nurses and hospital workers -- who were all putting their lives on the line, might be guilty of stealing desperately needed respirators and inflating the need for ventilators so they could hoard them. He publicly called out health care workers for their need of hundreds of thousands of masks when tens of thousands in the past were enough. He conveniently left out we're in the middle of a deadly pandemic. And the president had an offensive strategy prepared also. Daily briefings that last nearly 90 minutes were designed to show a president in charge, and a beneficial leader giving his people everything they wanted and needed. Trump touted big numbers on how many tests, protective equipment and ventilators were being produced every day, each time missing the context of how these numbers were just a drop in the bucket for the overall need -- both now and as the virus spreads. The president also used the presence of corporate leaders to highlight what the administration was doing with the private sector. The reality, though, is that many of the things that he promised would materialize quickly simply haven't -- like a Google national website, and nationwide testing in the parking lots of Target, Walgreens, Walmart and CVS. And every day he produced public health officials who looked like they were forced to praise the president publicly in return for any chance of influencing him in private. Most of all, he flooded the press with so much misinformation that the public couldn't keep up. By the time the press had caught up with one grandiose misstatement, he was on to several others. And with Trump's approval up modestly, the briefings might be having their intended effect. Attacking the press in the briefings is a critical part also. He both undermines the legitimacy of the accurate press reporting and plays to his base's contempt for the press in general. His latest move is the age-old practice of moving the goal posts. After spending months saying this would not be a problem in the US, the president is now posing a different test for himself. This weekend he said if he'd done nothing like many suggested, more than 2 million people would have died.   But because he is doing something, he claims, that number will be closer to 100,000-240,000. Of course, that ignores the impact of what little was done between January and February. Clearly the President is concerned about how the pandemic will affect his reelection chances. After all, November is just seven months away. His hope, now described as an ""aspiration,"" last week to open the country by Easter may have been driven by polls showing high anxiety over the economy.  But polls also consistently show that most Americans are worried about the public health aspect of the crisis.  The president's climb down can be traced in large part to what the polls were telling him. All of this confirms that while the president was slow off the mark to respond to the pandemic, he was always working off a political plan that had his reelection as the top priority.  In January and February his administration didn't see a political benefit in getting out ahead of this. In late March as the cases grew, that changed. But judging from his actions, it's still politics and reelection that are largely driving his response.  "
Schumer wants to deal with coronavirus crisis before talking infrastructure recovery plan," (CNN)Top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer on Wednesday dismissed the President's proposal of a $2 trillion infrastructure plan to counteract the coronavirus' economic effects, characterizing the effort as premature compared to the health care crisis triggered by the virus.CNN's Priscilla Alvarez, Lauren Fox and Paul LeBlanc contributed to this report. When asked by CNN's Erin Burnett whether he gave President Donald Trump credit for his willingness to make such a hefty investment, Schumer replied, ""I'd have to say seeing is believing."" ""We once asked him for that amount, Speaker (Nancy) Pelosi and I in the White House, and he sort of got up and walked out. So let's wait and see. Our immediate problem is dealing with the health care crisis,"" the New York Democrat added. ""Infrastructure is good -- I'm all for it, that's when we try to heal the economy,"" Schumer said. ""But until we get this crisis in order, the economy will get worse and worse and worse because people won't be at their jobs, people will be stuck in their homes."" Schumer called ""a dramatic shortage of all the needed supplies"" for those fighting the virus ""one of the greatest problems we face,"" lamenting that ""we have no one really in charge -- we have this awful spectacle of governors bidding against one another."" As hospitals reel from the growing number of coronavirus cases, Schumer's comments highlight two key story lines in the ongoing federal response -- state governors facing varying degrees of resistance in their requests for much-needed protective equipment from the federal government and Capitol Hill lawmakers and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin hashing out a fourth coronavirus spending package. Republicans are watching to see what happens before jumping into ""Phase 4"" negotiations. There are some reasons for that, not the least of which is the fact that the government still has to figure out how to disburse the last $2 trillion. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has made it clear in interviews this week that he wants to see the impact of the third stimulus bill before negotiating a fourth stimulus package. ""What I disagree with the speaker on is she is already saying we need to work on Phase Four. Well look, the current law has not been in effect for even a week ... (we) may need a Phase 4, but we are not even fully into Phase 3,"" McConnell said in a radio interview Wednesday morning. House Democrats, including Pelosi, meanwhile, have already started their push, talking to their conference about priorities including more payments to individuals, more money for states and for hospitals.  Part of Pelosi's focus on a ""Phase 4"" is based on internal Demcoratic politics, as the California Democrat had to lean on her caucus to vote for the last package despite the fact that it did not include everything Democrats had wanted. Her pitch then was ""Phase 4"" is around the corner, just vote for ""Phase 3,"" and more Democratic priorities would be in the next package. Democrats saw an opening on infrastructure on Tuesday after Trump tweeted his support for a package. House Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal has been talking to Mnuchin about this since December, and when Neal spoke with CNN on Tuesday, he was optimistic infrastructure could be a part of ""Phase 4"". But, Republicans aren't there yet and while he acknowledges that, he hopes GOP lawmakers will get on board. Schumer also disparaged Trump's choice of Peter Navarro as the federal government's national policy coordinator for the Defense Production Act, which gives the government more control during emergencies to direct industrial production. Trump invoked the act last week to compel General Motors to produce more ventilators for increasing coronavirus hospitalizations. Navarro ""is not up to the job,"" Schumer said. ""He's a very nice man, but he has had no experience doing things like this, and they have no one that I can best tell in charge of the distribution."" Schumer called on the administration to select ""one person, a military person, a general who knows how to deal with logistics and order mastering, who knows command and control."" That person should be ""in charge of both production and distribution of all the kinds of needed equipment and get it to the places that need it and have shortages,"" Schumer said, recommending that General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, could select a strong candidate for the role.

"Shin-Soo Choo pledges to give every Texas Rangers' minor league player $1,000"," (CNN)Shin-Soo Choo, an outfielder and designated hitter for the Texas Rangers, is giving every player in the Rangers' minor league system $1,000 to help alleviate the financial hit they may take amid the coronavirus pandemic.CNN's Kevin Dotson contributed to this report. That's 191 players, meaning the 37-year-old from South Korea is pledging $191,000. ""I can help other people,"" Choo, who is heading into his final year of a $130 million, seven-year contract, said Wednesday in a conference call. ""That's a good thing."" ""Twenty years ago ... coming from Korea, I (had) nothing,"" he said. ""Baseball gives me a lot of things. I want to pay back to other people...It's a hard situation in the world, but still I can help other people."" Choo spent seven years in the minor leagues. He remembers how little money he had in those days, and said at times he would skip dinner to keep his $20 meal money.  When he and his wife Won Mi Ha had their first child, Alan, in 2005, Choo said he had trouble having enough money to buy diapers. He estimated during that time he was earning about $350 a week. ""I don't want these guys' baseball careers affected by money,"" Choo said, adding that he hopes his donation can keep players in a position to focus on training at home, and perhaps one day reach the majors.  ""Probably a lot of guys maybe (are) looking for another job right now,"" he said. ""I don't want to lose any players over money."" Choo's major league career started in 2005 with the Seattle Mariners. He also played for the Cleveland Indians and briefly with the Cincinnati Reds. He joined the Rangers in 2014. On Tuesday, MLB announced it would extend its initiative to provide financial support to minor league players through the end of May or the beginning of the minor league season, whichever comes first, according to a statement from the league. A source with knowledge of the initiative told CNN that the plan will provide more than 7,000 minor league ballplayers with $400 a week during this time period. The affected players and their families also will continue to receive medical benefits during this time period. "
Biden campaign says it will arrange call with Trump about coronavirus," (CNN)A phone call between President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden, the leading Democratic contender for his position, is in the works to discuss the coronavirus pandemic.Sarah Westwood and Betsy Klein contributed to this report. ""Our teams will be in touch and we will arrange a call,"" said Kate Bedingfield, Biden's deputy campaign manager, in a statement Wednesday evening. The potential steps toward a call come after Trump was asked about Biden's offer to speak with him at his daily coronavirus press briefing.  ""I would absolutely take his call,"" Trump said. ""I would love to speak with him, sure."" The campaign had vaguely indicated willingness for a phone call earlier in the day, albeit with no concrete plan, after Kellyanne Conway, a counselor to the President, rebuked Biden for criticizing Trump's coronavirus response. ""I find it petty and partisan and completely unhelpful to the American population to have a former vice president, who was here for eight years, in his bunker in Wilmington just lobbing criticisms, reading from prepared notes and not that well,"" Conway said. Biden, for his part, has pushed back on any notion that his comments might politicize the pandemic, saying in an interview Monday on MSNBC, ""Everything that I have done has been designed to be constructive."" He added, ""The best I can do from my position is to lay out what I think should be done, how to do it, and when it's not being done, say why the experts say, 'This is what we should be doing. Let's do it.' "" Trump's willingness to speak to Biden about the coronavirus crisis would mark a shift in tone between the rivals. Biden has been sharply critical of the President's slow response to the crisis, accusing him of repeatedly misleading Americans about the risks of the virus and seeking to cast blame on others for shortages in personal protective equipment and flaws in testing. During CNN's town hall with Biden last week, he criticized the President for sparring with governors who have been critical of the federal response (including Trump's remark that Washington Gov. Jay Inslee was a ""snake""). ""This is not personal. It has nothing to do with you, Donald Trump, nothing to do with you, do your job. Stop personalizing everything,"" Biden said at the town hall last Friday night. The former vice president also wrote an op-ed on January 27 admonishing Trump as the ""worst possible"" leader to deal with the outbreak. ""I am concerned that the Trump administration's shortsighted policies have left us unprepared for a dangerous epidemic that will come sooner or later,"" Biden wrote at the time, when the United States had only a handful of confirmed coronavirus cases. He has since striven to remain a relevant voice in the national conversation as attention is focused on the virus by conducting television interviews and news briefings from a basement studio at his home in Wilmington, Delaware.  Though campaigning by all of the candidates -- Trump, Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont -- has been sharply curtailed while most of the country is operating under stay-at-home restrictions, the politicization of the pandemic has heated up on the airwaves.  Biden's campaign has released several digital coronavirus-related ads, some directly criticizing Trump and another pitching Biden as an empathetic leader in an implicit contrast with the President. Outside groups, including the super PAC supporting Biden's campaign, also have blasted Trump's response to the pandemic, accusing him of downplaying the severity of the crisis and suggesting that Democrats were exaggerating the potential impact of the pandemic to drag down his campaign.  On Wednesday, America First Action super PAC, which backs the Trump campaign, announced a $10 million ad buy that will target Biden in the key states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. Biden told CNN's Brooke Baldwin on Wednesday afternoon that the President needs to act like a wartime president during the struggle against the pandemic.  ""The President said he's a wartime president. This is a war against this virus. He should act like a wartime president,"" the former vice president said. This story has been updated with background information. "
FEMA sends EMTs and paramedics to New York City to help amid coronavirus crisis," (CNN)The Federal Emergency Management Agency sent hundreds of ambulances, EMTs and paramedics to New York City this week to help assist FDNY amid the coroanvirus pandemic.FDNY Commissioner Nigro thanks EMTs and paramedics from around the country who are here to assist FDNY with responding to a record number of medical calls. Read more:https://t.co/9aFv94LQy3 pic.twitter.com/8enfABScr2CNN's Mark Morales, Rob Frehse and Lauren del Valle contributed to this report New York is considered the epicenter of the  American coronavirus outbreak, with at least 83,712 reported cases of the virus and at least 1,941 deaths, according to CNN's latest tally of US cases. The additional help includes 250 ambulances and 500 EMTs, who will help transfer patients and respond to emergency calls. Emergency Medical Services (EMS) has received a record number of medical emergencies each day, with a 50% increase over normal daily call volume, FDNY said in its news release.  On Tuesday alone, FDNY EMS responded to 6,010 medical calls, Jim Long, a spokesperson for the department, told CNN. The fire department is also experiencing staffing shortages, with 2,900 FDNY members currently out sick, Long said. At least 282 of FDNY's members have tested positive for coronavirus, Long said. That figure includes firefighters, EMS and non-uniformed members. ""Right now we're in a bit of a crisis,"" FDNY Commissioner Daniel Nigro said. ""If we weren't, you wouldn't be here. There will be plenty of work for everyone and all I can say is, thank you so much for being there for the people of the City of New York. Being there for our agencies which are so overwhelmed, so overworked these last few weeks. They're normally overworked so you can imagine when you double that what happens."" The department is urging New Yorkers to only call 911 if it's a medical emergency or if people are feeling severely ill.  ""Our EMTs and paramedics are doing unbelievable work under the toughest of circumstances,"" Mayor Bill de Blasio said in a statement on Tuesday. ""This week, I promised them help was on the way, and today it is. Our partnership with FEMA will give our first responders the help they need to continue being the heroes of our city.""  "
Only some medical supplies from overseas going directly to coronavirus hotspots," (CNN)Only a portion of the medical supplies being flown in by the Federal Emergency Management Agency from overseas are being allotted to critical hotspots prioritized by the agency and the Department of Health and Human Services. CNN's Chandelis Duster contributed to this report. The rest will resupply the private market, where competition between states and the federal government has been a source of frustration for governors trying to shore up equipment to treat patients with coronavirus, according to multiple officials. The Trump administration has touted the incoming flights, billing them and the equipment they're bringing in as a reprieve to states desperate for supplies. But states are not the sole recipients of the equipment, according to a FEMA spokesperson. Supplies will also be sent to the private market, where states have been in fierce competition with each other to get hold of hard-to-come-by supplies. ""These supplies will soon be distributed around the country. We have large cargo planes coming in from various parts of the world,"" President Donald Trump said during Wednesday's briefing, noting it includes gloves, gowns, goggles and masks. ""We're adding more and more.""   Trump has suggested that states are overestimating their needs, previously saying, ""Some people frankly think they need them and they don't need,"" referring to ventilators.  To fill the supply shortage, FEMA is chartering overseas flights with medical supplies secured by private companies. On the first overseas flight that landed at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport on Sunday, according to FEMA, the federal agency purchased 60% of the supplies from the private company, and distributed the supplies in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. The remaining 40% of the supplies on the flight went back to the private market. In the overseas flights that have followed, however, FEMA has given the private companies supplying medical equipment a list of prioritized hot spots, identified by FEMA and HHS, that should receive at least 50% of supplies from the flight. According to one official, each chartered flight will be different in terms of what resources get distributed where, based on contracts negotiated by the government and the companies providing the supplies. As of noon Wednesday, four flights -- all chartered by FEMA -- had arrived with supplies, according to FEMA. The agency has not released a list of the counties that will receive supplies but indicated they include areas in New York, Connecticut, New Jersey, the District of Columbia, Illinois, Texas, Florida, Washington and California. FEMA, an agency within the Department of Homeland Security, has been fielding requests for medical supplies and personal protective equipment from states. The agency says it's focusing allocation of resources to ""highly impacted areas,"" but some governors, like Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, say they've faced pushback to those requests. Pritzker told CNN that Vice President Mike Pence shot down the state's estimate of how many ventilators were needed.  ""Well, unfortunately, we, as I said, we need 4,000 ventilators,"" Pritzker told CNN Tuesday. ""And I spoke with the vice president earlier today. When I said that and repeated that to him, he said, 'Well, our models show that maybe you need 1,400 ventilators.'"" Montana Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock told CNN's Alisyn Camerota on ""New Day"" Thursday that getting help from private companies is ""our only hope"" because of the difficulty in getting supplies from the the Strategic National Stockpile and because of the competition between other states and the federal government. ""Everything that's brought, 80% of it, is just dumped into the private market. So then governors are competing against one another, at times the federal government, to try to get these supplies,"" Bullock said. Requests are being adjudicated against need and priority, according to a senior DHS official, who added algorithms are being developed to help in the decision-making process.  FEMA told stakeholders earlier this week that it's distributing resources based on ""data-informed"" decisions that will be coordinated between the US government and the private sector, according to an advisory obtained by CNN. As the government enlists companies to ramp up production, the so-called National Resource Prioritization Cell has also been established to ""unify government and private industry prioritization recommendations which will inform federal, state and private sector operations,"" according to the advisory. The agency also provided guidance on questions regarding requests for ventilators, a critical item for treating some coronavirus patients. Among the questions is how many usable ventilators, ICU beds, and convertible ventilators are available within the state or tribe, how many anesthesia machines does a state or tribe have and have they been converted, among others.  Still, there's been widespread confusion among governors and lawmakers about distribution decisions. Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts requested information on how the federal government plans to get equipment to her state in a letter to FEMA Administrator Pete Gaynor. Washington, one of the states hardest hit by coronavirus, has also received little explanation as to why they haven't received certain supplies and equipment. One of the sources of supplies -- the Strategic National Stockpile -- is deploying the last round of shipments in its inventory, depleting the bulk of its protective gear, according to a source familiar. As the National Stockpile runs low, FEMA is assessing the global market for much needed medical supplies and working with private entities to secure and distribute that equipment to health care workers across the country. The chartered flights, according to the administration, will expedite the process for companies seeking to get medical supplies to clients in the US. But where those items will go is still not a guarantee, even for states where the flights are expected to land. A senior Illinois state official told CNN's Jake Tapper on Wednesday that the state was not benefiting from the supplies coming to their state. Referring to ""Project Airbridge"" -- the airlift of supplies -- the official said ""all the goods went to other states.""  ""We got nothing,"" the official added.  "
"2 dead from coronavirus, 45 ill after March choir rehearsal"," (CNN)Two people have died from Covid-19 and 45 people are ill after a March 10 choir practice in Washington state, health officials said. Of the some 60 people who attended the Skagit Valley Chorale rehearsal in Mount Vernon, 28 members have confirmed cases of the virus, according to Kayla Schott-Bresler of Skagit County Public Health. The practice was in full compliance with state guidance at the time, a statement from the group said. ""Please know that this has been an extremely difficult and sad time for chorale members and leadership,"" the group said. ""Our group feels like a family, so you might imagine our grief."" There were no known cases of the coronavirus on the day of the rehearsal, the group said. ""There were no closures of schools, restaurants, churches, bowling alleys, banks, libraries, theaters, or any other businesses,"" the statement said. ""The advice from the State of Washington was to limit gatherings to 250 people."" The chorale's board of directors told members not to come if they were showing any signs of illness or if they felt ""their health or safety was in jeopardy."" One member told CNN affiliate KIRO that no one seemed to be ill. ""During the entire rehearsal, no one sneezed, no one coughed, no one there appeared to be sick in any way,"" Carolynn Comstock told KIRO. ""So now we know, oh hm, maybe it's transmitted not just by droplets and sneezes or coughs; maybe it's transmitted just by people talking, just by people being around each other,"" Comstock said. ""And then of course, if you're singing there's more volume to the talking, deep breathing and more volume."" The chorale said it's sharing its story ""so that it might personalize this virus for others. Our hope is to encourage everyone to stay home and stay safe."" "
"Source close to coronavirus task force: Despite what White House is saying, tougher measures implemented earlier 'might have made a difference'"," (CNN)Despite White House claims that President Donald Trump and the administration did everything right in response to the coronavirus, a source close to the task force said tougher social distancing measures implemented earlier in the pandemic could have blunted the severity of the current crisis.   It all depends, the source said, whether there were coronavirus infections in the US that were going undetected during the initial weeks of the outbreak, when the Trump administration was falling behind on testing for the virus nationwide. Numerous public health experts have said those cases were likely going undetected, considering the lack of widespread testing. ""If there were no infections out there, then there was nothing to mitigate,"" the source said. ""If there were infections under the radar, it might have made a difference."" A Trump adviser working with White House officials on messaging for the pandemic response said Trump ""took a gamble"" that warmer weather would cause the virus to dissipate, siding with aides who were pushing back on the dire warnings coming from doctors on the coronavirus task force. On February 10, Trump had said of the virus: ""You know, a lot of people think that goes away in April with the heat  as the heat comes in. Typically, that will go away in April. We're in great shape though. We have 12 cases -- 11 cases, and many of them are in good shape now."" On March 5, the World Health Organization said the idea was worth investigating, but advised the concept was not a sure thing.  The adviser said the President took a gamble ""and got it wrong"" in reference to Trump's decision to ignore the predictions from the administration's own experts.  ""He analyzed the data and opinions of experts and sided with the one that said warm weather will likely slow the virus,"" the adviser added.  That was before Trump abruptly changed course Tuesday and offered a sober briefing on the potential for more than 100,000 US deaths as a result of the virus. In early February, Trump tweeted that China's handling of the outbreak would be helped by warming weather, but several infectious disease experts told CNN at the time that not enough was known about how this coronavirus, which had just been discovered in humans in December, would react to changing temperatures. And Vice President Mike Pence told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Wednesday that Trump's past statements that seemed to downplay the coronavirus outbreak were based in optimism. Pence also denied Trump had minimized the crisis early on, despite repeated statements casting the virus as a problem that would be easily solved. ""I don't believe the President has ever belittled the threat of the coronavirus,"" Pence said. Given examples of the President doing just that -- either by comparing it favorably to the flu or auto accidents or by saying cases would get to zero quickly -- Pence said Trump was trying to maintain a rosy outlook. ""The President is an optimistic person,"" Pence told Blitzer. ""We've been from the very beginning, when the President suspended all travel from China and stood up the White House coronavirus task force in January, we have been hoping for the best but planning for the worst, and that's been being worked out every single day. And what the American people can see in this President every day is a leader who knows that we will get through this."" "
"Adam Schlesinger, Fountains of Wayne singer, dead at 52 from Covid-19"," (CNN)Adam Schlesinger, the co-founder of pop-rock band Fountains of Wayne and an Oscar-nominated songwriter, has died from complications related to coronavirus. He was 52.  ""As many of you are aware, Adam had been hospitalized with Covid-19 and although he had been making some small improvements over the last few days, Adam's condition was critical and he was ultimately unable to recover from Covid-19 complications,"" read a statement from the band's attorney, provided to CNN. ""He was truly a prolific talent and even more so, a loving and devoted father, son and friend.""  It added: ""We are terribly sorry to convey this loss.""  Schlesinger's band, which was co-founded with Chris Collingwood, was best known for its 2003 hit ""Stacy's Mom,"" a humorous track about a young boy who has a crush on his friend's mother. The song was nominated for a Grammy Award.  But Schlesinger had success before that as a songwriter. He co-wrote the title track to the 1996 Tom Hanks film ""That Thing You Do,"" and received Oscar and Golden Globe nominations for his work.  After success with Fountains of Wayne, Schlesinger continued to branch out, earning Tony nominations for his work on the musical ""Cry-Baby"" and numerous Emmy nominations for other work, which included collaborations with Stephen Colbert and ""Sesame Street.""  He won an Emmy last year for a song he co-wrote for CW's ""Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,"" a show for which he wrote more than 100 songs and earned several nominations over the years.  Schlesinger was hospitalized this week.  A statement from his family, released by Collingwood via Twitter, confirmed Schlesinger was diagnosed with Covid-19. Schlesinger was put on a ventilator and sedated ""to facilitate his recovery.""  ""He is receiving excellent care, his condition is improving and we are cautiously optimistic,"" the statement said. ""His family appreciates all of the love and support.""  News of his illness prompted an outpouring of well wishes from the music industry and beyond, as did word of his passing.  ""I am grasping for the right words. My dear friend Adam Schlesinger has passed away from Covid-19,"" wrote Dashboard Confessional singer Chris Carrabba on Twitter. ""I knew him best as a mentor, and a friend.""  He added: ""We must take this seriously. People are sick and dying. It is hard to stay locked indoors but lives will be saved. Take care of each other. Rest In Peace, my dear friend."" Schlesinger was writing the lyrics and music for a new theater production with comedian Sarah Silverman at the time of his death, the attorney's statement added.   Schlesinger was survived by his two daughters, Sadie and Claire, his life partner Alexis Morley, his parents Barbara and Stephen Schlesinger and his sister Lauren, according to the statement.  "
Trump uses coronavirus briefing to unveil new military counternarcotics mission,"Washington (CNN)On a day when more than 800 Americans died of the coronavirus, President Donald Trump used his daily briefing on the pandemic to unveil seemingly unrelated counternarcotics operations that senior officials said would hurt embattled Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro.  CNN's Jason Hoffman contributed to this report.  ""Today the United States is launching enhanced counternarcotics operations in the Western Hemisphere to protect the American people from the deadly scourge of illegal narcotics,"" Trump said. The announcement coincides with a renewed Trump administration push to oust Maduro, an effort that began in January 2019 and has yet to yield results. It also came on a day when the US registered the most deaths from the coronavirus in a single day, with at least 869 reported on Wednesday, bringing the total to 4,703. The day before, Trump had delivered the starkest estimate of the pandemic's toll in the US, telling Americans that even if recommended distancing measures are followed closely, up to 240,000 Americans could die. The next two weeks, he added, will likely be ""painful"" and ""tough.""   'A record pace' Speaking at the White House podium flanked by security officials, the President said Wednesday that ""in cooperation with the 22 partner operations, the US Southern Command will increase surveillance, seizures of drug shipments, and provide additional support for eradication efforts that are going on right now at a record pace.""  Operations will take place in the eastern Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea. The military itself has been struggling to deal with the pandemic. The commander of the USS Theodore Roosevelt, a US Navy aircraft carrier where an outbreak of the coronavirus has spread to at least 70 sailors, warned in a dramatic memo Tuesday that decisive action was required to save the lives of the ship's crew. ""We are not at war. Sailors do not need to die,"" Capt. Brett Crozier wrote to the Navy's Pacific Fleet, three US defense officials have confirmed to CNN. ""The spread of the disease is ongoing and accelerating,"" he added. As of Wednesday morning, 814 US service members have tested positive for the virus, while the first military death was announced Monday.  Secretary of Defense Mark Esper drew a link between the pandemic and the new military operation, saying that criminal organizations are trying to capitalize on the fact that governments are distracted by the outbreak. ""Transnational criminal organizations continue to threaten our security"" and ""destroy lives,"" he said. Esper went on to say that this operation would hurt Maduro's grip on power in Venezuela. ""Furthermore, corrupt actors like the illegitimate Maduro regime in Venezuela rely on the profits derived from the sale of narcotics to maintain their oppressive hold on power. The Venezuelan people continue to suffer due to Maduro's criminal control of the country,"" Esper said. US operations would focus on the ""eastern Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea,"" Esper said, and would involve an array of military assets.  ""Included in the force package are Navy destroyers and combat ships, Coast Guard cutters, P-8 patrol aircraft and elements of an Army Security Force Assistance Brigade. These additional forces will nearly double our capacity to conduct counternarcotics operations in the region,"" Esper said.  Warships were focused on Beijing and Moscow Despite Esper's repeated insistence that the Pentagon is most focused on countering threats posed by China and Russia, the additional warships will be drawn from Indo-Pacific Command and European Command, the military commands focused on Beijing and Moscow. ""We came upon some intelligence some time ago that the drug cartels as a result of Covid-19 were going to try and take advantage of the situation and try to infiltrate additional drugs into our country,"" the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Mark Milley, said Wednesday. ""We're at war with Covid-19, we're at war with terrorists and we are at war with the drug cartels as well,"" Milley said, adding, ""We will marshal whatever assets are required to prevent your entry into this country to kill Americans."" The Trump administration launched its latest effort to oust Maduro on Tuesday, leveraging the coronavirus pandemic to apply additional pressure.  ""The United States has long been committed to finding a solution to the man-made crisis in Venezuela,"" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement. ""The urgency for this has become all the more serious in light of the Maduro regime's failure to adequately prepare for and address the global COVID-19 pandemic.""   Speaking at the State Department, Pompeo outlined a plan to establish a transitional government and, ""if the conditions of the framework are met,"" lift sanctions on Venezuela. The Maduro government rejected it almost immediately.  The US hopes its newly proposed framework will facilitate a democratic transition in Venezuela, more than a year after initial attempts to force Maduro from power. Those conditions include ""the departure of foreign security forces and elections deemed free and fair by international observers,"" Pompeo said.  "
"Filipino nurses are on the frontline underprotected.

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. (CNN)Every day, Filipina nurse April Abrias walks six miles to monitor 30 patients who are suspected to have the novel coronavirus in a rural province north of the Philippines' capital, Manila.""I'm ready but not well-equipped (but) it's my duty to help in this time of pandemic.""April AbriasDr. Anthony Cortez shows the temporary face protection equipment he has made. He said medics are hoping for the new personal protective equipment.Some medics are using helmets designed for use on construction sites.Nurses use tissue paper to add layers of protection to their cloth face masks, which they reuse after washing.""It's expensive to study to become a nurse and I do not think it's fair that we need to volunteer without pay.""Rosalie NatividadRosalie Natividad administers a vaccine to a baby in a clinic.Rosalie Natividad uses a thermometer to check the temperature of Joan Santos, who is under home quarantine.Rosalie Natividad shares her alcohol spray with an old lady at the market.Edited by Hilary Whiteman and Jenni Marsh The 29-year-old midwife doesn't have a surgical mask to cover her face -- instead, she wears a cloth mask that provides insufficient protection from the virus, which has killed more than 46,000 people worldwide, according to figures from Johns Hopkins University. At least 17 frontline coronavirus medics have already died in the Philippines, and more than 600 have been in quarantine, according to CNN Philippines. Abrias not only worries for her profession. As she makes her daily calls, there is little to stop her from spreading the virus. One of her patients lives in a fruit and vegetable market, which as an essential service isn't subject to the same lockdown rules that have silenced busy streets across the island of Luzon since March 17. Abrias said the patient had a fever and body aches, so she told him to self-quarantine in his shop and avoid interacting with other people. He hasn't been tested for the coronavirus, she said, because there are no testing kits. Abrias has to assume that he has the infectious disease, and that's what makes it so scary. ""Doctors and other health care workers (here) work under conditions of a desperate lack of personal protective equipment, as do others in many other countries,"" said Esperanza Cabral, a Filipino cardiologist and clinical pharmacologist, who once served as the Secretary of the Philippines Health Department. The World Health Organization says 96 people have died from the coronavirus in the Philippines, a country of 105 million people, and medical officers are warning of an impending crisis if help doesn't come soon. Covid-19 in the Philippines The Philippines reported its first case of the coronavirus to the World Health Organization in late January, and its first death just days later. More than 50 million people are now living under lockdown rules imposed by President Rodrigo Duterte, who last week secured powers to unlock billions of dollars of emergency funds. Schools and shopping malls have closed, mass gathering are banned and people across Luzon have been told to stay home. The rules don't apply to Anthony Cortez and his team of 40 rural health workers who cover Bambang, a city of around 53,000 people, an eight-hour drive north of the capital Manila, in Nueva Vizcaya province. Rural workers are the first line of defense. Before being admitted to a hospital, a patient will first be assessed and monitored by one of Cortez's team, mostly midwives who are now dealing with Covid-19 patients due to a lack of staff. He isn't confident of his team's ability to deal with the contagious coronavirus with so little personal protective equipment (PPE). According to World Health Organization guidelines, medical staff treating coronavirus patients should wear gloves, medical masks, goggles or a face shield, and body-covering gowns.    Cortez's team has none of this. So they are making their own. ""We resorted to innovations, so that we have some protection. The cloth mask ideally is not acceptable in the scientific field but rather than wearing nothing, without any protection, I would rather have this,"" he said. Dr. Gloria Balboa, of the Department of Health, said: ""Unfortunately, there is a shortage of the needed logistics like PPEs not only in the Philippines but globally.""  Last weekend, in a radio interview, Health Secretary Dr. Francisco Duque III said that the government had acquired 1 million PPEs worth 1.8 billion pesos ($35 million) and is still awaiting their delivery. Exodus of health care workers Rosalie Natividad had studied nursing with hopes of landing a job overseas and sending money home to support her family, like many other Filipino health care workers do. That's because many nurses in the Philippines are required to do unpaid volunteer work, often described as a ""training program,"" until they can secure a contract. Their workload is similar to that of a paid nurse, and they work in hospital wards and health centers. Due to the lack of employment opportunities in the Philippines, nurses are often faced with no option but to comply. Natividad applied for a nursing job in Saudi Arabia, despite being afraid of the Middle Eastern country's strict laws. The starting salary for a nurse in Saudi Arabia is 4,100 Riyals ($1,089) per month -- more than double what she could earn at home, says Natividad.  But she didn't get the job because she lacked experience, and so became an insurance agent. Last year, however, Natividad returned to the profession during a Department of Health hiring program for nurses in rural areas. Her six-month contract ends in June, but she is more worried about what the months ahead will bring as the coronavirus spreads through the Philippines. ""I'm worried about the virus. I'm the breadwinner and if I get sick, who will help my family? We don't see the enemy, and the health workers are the first ones that will be infected,"" she said. Reigner Antiquera, president of the Alliance of Young Nurse Leaders and Advocates, an organization that advocates nurses rights and welfare, said nurses were taking huge personal risks to treat patients. ""Nurses are the most at risk of contracting the Covid-19 if the government will continue to disregard the plea of the nurses and other health workers in providing adequate personal protective equipment and other security measures,"" he said in a statement. 'Hugging is not allowed' When the pandemic began, it was difficult for Abrias to explain to her children that hugging is not allowed anymore when she comes home each night. Every day, before entering their home, her son waits while she disinfects herself. Her biggest fear is catching the coronavirus and passing it to her children. Abrias has not been trained as a frontline health worker. She is a midwife, still expected to deliver babies and give immunizations, and employed on a short-term contract, which pays her 17,000 Philippine pesos ($334) per month. For her new duties on the frontline, she receives 500 Philippine pesos ($9.83) per month in hazard pay, but no transportation allowance. That's why she walks. ""I walked from house to house and sometimes, people blame me for doing my job and it hurts. I wish they will cooperate instead,"" she said. People know that Abrias monitors potential coronavirus patients and are worried she will carry the virus from village to village.  One of April's patients is Joan Santos, a Filipina nurse who recently returned home from Orange County, California. As a recent returnee from the US, she was ordered to spend 14 days in home quarantine to avoid spreading the virus, supervised by Abrias, who visits every day to check her temperature. Both women are healthworkers, but one has more safety equipment than the other. Santos brought home from the US a supply of medical-grade N95 masks for herself and her family. She wears it to protect herself from possible contagion -- from her nurse. "
Documents show the struggle to keep pace with the pandemic at just one US lab company," (CNN)As the US health care system has scrambled to track the spread of coronavirus, one of the nation's largest commercial labs has faced a backlog of tests that ballooned in the last two weeks, and has delayed results in some cases up to 10 days.    New Jersey-based Quest Diagnostics had about 160,000 coronavirus test orders waiting to be processed on March 25, which amounted to about half of the 320,000 total orders for the tests the company had received up to that date, according to Quest internal materials obtained by CNN. The company, which is now testing for the virus at a dozen labs across the country, referred to the orders as a ""significant amount of backlog,"" according to the materials.  Although a vast network of labs at public health departments and universities are also testing for the novel coronavirus, the Trump administration has leaned on commercial labs, which have greater capacity, to roll out widespread testing Quest and an array of other commercial labs have launched and expanded their testing capacity over the last month, and on Monday President Donald Trump announced that the US had tested more than 1 million people for the virus. Yet health care workers, state officials and others have criticized the pace of coronavirus testing in the US as insufficient to enable timely quarantining of patients and to obtain an accurate understanding of the virus' scope. The White House warned Tuesday that the virus could lead to the deaths of anywhere from 100,000 to 240,000 Americans.  Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said on Sunday that safely loosening restrictions on businesses and public gatherings in the US depends on the availability of more rapid testing. ""So that when you identify someone who's infected, that person doesn't go out into society for a few days, infect a bunch of people, and then you bring them back because the test is positive,"" Fauci said on CNN's ""State of the Union.""   A spokesperson for Quest, Wendy Bost, told CNN the backlog for coronavirus tests has begun to shrink in recent days as the company has expanded its capacity, which now amounts to more than 30,000 tests a day and an average turnaround time of four to five days.   ""Much of the backlog was due to huge demand in the early days of testing when we were primarily offering a lab-developed test we developed at a single laboratory,"" Bost said. ""In recent days, our capacity has exceeded our demand, allowing us to reduce the backlog.""   After CNN published this report, Quest posted a statement on its website Wednesday night that said the company currently has a backlog of 115,000 tests. Quest is not alone in dealing with turnaround times of multiple days and other testing complications resulting from extreme demand. LabCorp, another major commercial lab company, said turnaround time for results is approximately four to five days, though that varies depending on factors such as transport time. ARUP Laboratories earlier this month was accepting specimens for coronavirus testing outside of its home state of Utah but stopped that about two weeks ago due to ""supply constraints in the face of extraordinary demand,"" the company said.  In March, leaders from Quest, LabCorp and other companies met with White House officials to discuss expanded testing. President Trump touted the plan as ""a new partnership with private sector to vastly increase and accelerate our capacity to test for the coronavirus."" But some health care workers have told CNN testing has not accelerated fast enough. Dr. Joseph Kanter, an ER doctor in New Orleans and the Assistant State Health Officer for the Louisiana Department of Health, said longer wait times for test results force hospitals to use more personal protective equipment, which is in short supply nationally and must be used when treating patients who have been tested until it's confirmed they do not have the virus.   ""The faster we can turn those tests around, some of those will be negative and we'll save the PPE burn,"" Kanter said. ""It's getting better, but it still is a bottleneck."" Megan Schlanser, a nurse in Michigan, said limited testing has prevented frontline health workers, including some of her colleagues who feel sick, from knowing whether they have contracted the virus.  ""We're not getting tested,"" Schlanser said. ""The scary thing is that we could potentially all be carriers and even not even show symptoms... so I could be potentially infecting all of my coworkers."" Some patients who waited initially to even get tested for the virus have yet to get their results. Shannon Mason, a 38-year-old attorney in northern California, tells CNN she is still waiting for the result of the Covid-19 test she had on March 18.  Mason, who said she is at particularly high risk because she has an immune dysfunction, said she became very sick with a cough and fever in February that became a respiratory infection. She finally went to the ER at the University of California-Davis Medical Center in Sacramento. ""I was feeling really bad. That's the worst I've ever felt,"" said Mason, who said she tested negative for the flu. Mason is still waiting for the results of her test, and said she has repeatedly called the medical center and asked for her result, but said no one seems to know the result. CNN contacted the medical center but did immediately not hear back. After publication, the medical center said they ""are looking into"" the issue.  Various hospital systems have begun implementing their own internal coronavirus testing, which cuts the time needed to ship specimens to external labs. The Yale New Haven Health System does its own in-house testing for the sickest patients and critical health care workers, but the rest are sent to outside labs.  ""Initially, we sent out a lot of samples to Quest but their turnaround times were quite delayed recently, sometimes over a week,"" said Steven Choi, the health system's chief quality officer. ""We're now transitioning to the Mayo Clinic Labs for our outpatient specimen testing."" A spokesperson for the RWJBarnabas Health hospital system in New Jersey told CNN its in-house testing has a turnaround time of a few hours, but the majority of its tests are still sent to private labs that require five to 10 days for results.  The Henry Ford Health System in Michigan said test results for admitted patients are returned in 24 hours but outpatients' samples are sent to an outside lab that typically provides results in about a week.  Bost, the Quest spokesperson, told CNN that while hospitals may be able to efficiently test ill hospital patients, commercial labs like Quest have the capacity and logistical operations to test far greater numbers of patients at regional levels.   Bost added that global supply chain issues have constrained labs throughout the country.  Medical officials at several state departments and labs told CNN in March they needed more swabs and reagents, which are used to extract the genetic code of a virus from swabs, along with other materials to conduct Covid-19 tests.  A spokesperson for the University of Nebraska said on Tuesday that the two labs on campus testing for coronavirus have been able to turnaround results in four to six hours but due to a lack of reagents, the labs have had to limit capacity.  At Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Tennessee, overall volume of testing and a shortage of reagents caused its lab's backlog to jump over the last week from a 48-to-72-hour timeframe to five-to-seven days. ""We have the reagent back in stock but it took several days. During that time we had samples accumulate in the queue,"" said spokesperson John Howser. Some commercial labs have said they have cut backlogs that developed after they initially rolled out coronavirus tests. A spokesperson for the company Eurofins, for example, said its labs are now running 7,000 tests a day with a 24-hour turnaround time.  Caroline Buckee, an associate professor of epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said that until the US health care system develops the capacity to widely test patients, including those only exhibiting mild symptoms, the full scope of the virus cannot be fully understood and effectively addressed. ""Right now we are not testing enough people so we don't know what's happening with community-level transmission, and we're almost certainly missing many cases,"" Buckee said. This story has been updated Wednesday night to reflect University of California-Davis Medical Center's response that they are ""looking into"" Mason's case and to include Quest's current backlog. "
More than 60 residents of an Italian elder care home died in a month," (CNN)More than a third of residents in an elder care home near Milan died in less than a month during the coronavirus pandemic, a spokesperson for the facility has revealed.Livia Borghese reported from Rome and Sharon Braithwaite from London. CNN's Sarah Dean also contributed to this report. Sara Aragno told CNN on Wednesday that 63 out of 150 residents at Borromea Residence, a care home in the Mediglia municipality, had died since early March. The first of the 63 deaths at the home happened on March 3, in the earlier stages of Italy's battle with a coronavirus outbreak that has now killed more than 13,000 people in the country. It is not known how many of these 63 residents had been infected with the coronavirus, because only 36 residents have been tested. All 36 tested positive but not all have died. No postmortem tests have, or will be, carried out, Aragno said. However, doctors might find out more from their clinical records. Mediglia, a village of 12,000 people in the northern Lombardy region, is geographically very close to the original coronavirus cluster reported in the country. ""I signed an ordinance on February 23 forbidding all non-medical staff to enter in the care house,"" the Mayor of Mediglia, Paolo Bianchi, told CNN Wednesday. ""I receive every day updated death tolls, and I noticed they were growing and growing."" It is feared that the actual number of deaths from the coronavirus pandemic in Italy might be much higher than the official number, because not everyone who dies outside of hospital is tested for the virus. ""It is plausible that deaths are underestimated,"" Silvio Brusaferro, head of the national health institute, said in a news conference on Tuesday. ""We report deaths that are signaled with a positive swab. Many other deaths are not tested with a swab."" The care home said it had made phone contact with relatives seeking information on their loved ones. ""We understand their anguish,"" the spokesperson said. ""We have taken all the necessary measures: we have divided those with symptoms on a floor and those without in another floor and we check the temperature of our staff three times a day."" However, that is not always enough to protect the elderly. ""The elderly are the most exposed to fatal events, over 80% of the deaths are over 70, hospices without a doubt can represent a reality that favors the epidemic spread,"" said Franco Locatelli, head of the Superior Health Council, in a news conference.  According to a statement from the Italian Society of Gerontology and Geriatrics on March 30, Italy's 7,000 care homes are ""neither equipped nor have trained personnel"" and they can become ""biological bombs of contagion."" The society made the statement while announcing it had started a blood survey to evaluate the effectiveness of diagnostic criteria in nursing homes. "
11 times Donald Trump has 'belittled' coronavirus," (CNN)Vice President Mike Pence said something truly unbelievable in an interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Wednesday. THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! In each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! ""I don't believe the President has ever belittled the threat of the coronavirus,"" the vice president told Wolf. Which, even by Pence standards -- the VP is an unstinting, 100% supporter of President Donald Trump -- is pretty bad. So, as a public service, here are 11 times where Trump ""belittled"" or otherwise downplayed the threat posed by coronavirus. 1. ""We have it totally under control. It's one person coming in from China, and we have it under control. It's going to be just fine."" (January 22) 2. ""We pretty much shut it down coming in from China."" (February 2) 3. ""The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA. We are in contact with everyone and all relevant countries. CDC & World Health have been working hard and very smart. Stock Market starting to look very good to me!"" (February 22) 4. ""We're going very substantially down, not up. ... We have it so well under control. I mean, we really have done a very good job."" (February 26) 5. ""This is a flu. This is like a flu. ... It's a little like the regular flu that we have flu shots for. And we'll essentially have a flu shot for this in a fairly quick manner."" (February 26) 6. ""It's going to disappear. One day —it's like a miracle — it will disappear. And from our shores, we — you know, it could get worse before it gets better. It could maybe go away. We'll see what happens. Nobody really knows."" (February 27) 7.  ""No, I'm not concerned at all. No, I'm not. No, we've done a great job."" (March 8) 8. ""So last year 37,000 Americans died from the common Flu. It averages between 27,000 and 70,000 per year. Nothing is shut down, life & the economy go on. At this moment there are 546 confirmed cases of CoronaVirus, with 22 death. Think about that!"" (March 9) 9. ""This is a very contagious virus. It's incredible. But it's something we have tremendous control of."" (March 15) 10. ""I don't believe you need 40,000 or 30,000 ventilators. You know, you're going to major hospitals sometimes, they'll have two ventilators. And now, all of a sudden, they're saying, can we order 30,000 ventilators?"" (March 27) 11. ""You call it germ, you can call it a flu. You can call it a virus. You can call it many different names. I'm not sure anybody knows what it is."" (March 27) The Point: If you don't get it, you don't get it. "
White House press secretary invites far-right personality to attend coronavirus briefing in violation of new social distancing rules,"New York (CNN Business)The White House Correspondents Association on Wednesday voted to remove One America News, a small right-wing media organization, from the rotation for a seat in the briefing room, an extraordinary rebuke of the network for violating social distancing guidelines put into place to protect the health of its members.  ""We do not take this action lightly,"" the WHCA board wrote in an email to members, notifying them of the decision. ""This is a matter of public safety."" The decision was made after a fringe personality for the far-right media outlet, Chanel Rion, continued to attend the briefings, in defiance of the WHCA's new rules limiting the number of journalists in the room. The rule recently implemented by the WHCA restricts the number of journalists who can attend the briefings to increase the distance between reporters in the James S. Brady Press Briefing Room. Rion, who has produced what amounts to pro-Trump propaganda for OAN, attended both Tuesday and Wednesday's briefings, standing in the back of the room. Jon Karl, president of the White House Correspondents Association, told CNN earlier on Wednesday that its members have agreed they ""cannot be in the briefing room"" if they ""do not have a seat"" assigned on a particular day. ""So a reporter standing in the back who does not have a seat on that day is violating those rules and putting the health of the press corps in danger,"" Karl added. In its note to members, the WHCA board explained it took action Wednesday because Rion ""twice attended press briefings in contravention"" of its new policy. When Rion showed up to the briefing on Tuesday, she declined to leave and told a representative for the WHCA that she was a ""guest of Stephanie Grisham,"" the White House press secretary, a person familiar with the exchange told CNN. The WHCA is the organization responsible for assigning seats at the James S. Brady Press Briefing Room, not the White House press secretary. Rion added that the representative for the WHCA could take up the matter with Grisham, the person familiar with the matter added. The Los Angeles Times was first to report the interaction between Rion and the WHCA. Grisham declined to comment on the record. Rion did not respond to a request for comment. Rion again showed up to the briefing on Wednesday, standing in the back and being called on by President Donald Trump. One America News is a cable channel with small viewership that is strongly supportive of Trump, who has repeatedly lauded the outlet for being friendly toward him. Rion is a far-right media personality with a history of peddling conspiracy theories. Rion has pushed the discredited idea that slain Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich was murdered by the Clinton family. In December, Rion traveled with Rudy Giuliani, Trump's personal attorney, to Ukraine and advanced conspiracy theories that aimed to give Trump cover for asking the country to investigate former Vice President and Democratic presidential frontrunner Joe Biden. Most recently, Rion promoted the conspiracy theory that the novel coronavirus was potentially created in a North Carolina laboratory. "
Trump threatens heavy price if Iran conducts 'sneak attack' on US troops,"Washington (CNN)President Donald Trump tweeted Wednesday, without citing any evidence, that the administration has information that ""Iran or its proxies are planning a sneak attack on US troops and/or assets in Iraq."" Trump added, ""If this happens, Iran will pay a very heavy price, indeed!""CNN's Ryan Browne and Nikki Carvajal contributed to this report. The President's tweet, which the White House did not elaborate upon, comes as the US has picked up more intelligence in the last several days from an ongoing stream indicating that Iranian-backed militias inside Iraq are potentially planning an attack against US forces in the near future, one US official said.  The intelligence is some of the latest in a threat stream that the US has been monitoring in Iraq in recent months, the official said. It follows the US killing of Iran's second most powerful official, Gen. Qasem Soleimani, in January, and tit-for-tat strikes between the US and Iraq-based militias in March.  Later on Wednesday, when a reporter asked for details on what his tweet meant, Trump said he didn't want to elaborate. ""I don't want to say, but we just have information that they were planning something, and it's very good information,"" the President said. He added that the plot ""was led by Iran."" ""Not necessarily Iran, but by groups supported by Iran, but that to me is Iran,"" he added. Trump said the message was meant as a warning to the country. ""We're just saying don't do it,"" he said. ""Don't do it. It would be a very bad thing if they did it."" On March 12, US warplanes struck five targets in southern Iraq affiliated with a militia with ties to Iran after a rocket attack the day before killed two Americans and a British soldier. Secretary of Defense Mark Esper the attack was carried out by Iranian-backed Shia militia groups. Soleimani's killing prompted calls for revenge from Iranian officials and affiliated militias in the region.  This newest intelligence includes information gathered from people in the region as well as communications intercepts, the official said. It comes as Iran is reeling from the coronavirus pandemic, which has killed senior officials, sent others into isolation and left health systems overwhelmed by an estimated 47,000 known infections, according to the World Health Organization.    The coronavirus has slowed down much of Iran's planning and it is possible it could still stall any attack, the official said. Since the US killed Soleimani, there has not been a leader of his influence over the militias and the forces he once controlled inside Iraq, adding to uncertainty.  The New York Times has reported that there has been tension within the Trump administration about whether to escalate military action against Iran, with officials such as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo urging a harder response after the March 11 killing of the two Americans.  Pompeo and national security adviser Robert O'Brien have argued that a hard response to Iran while the coronavirus pummels the country would make its leaders more open to negotiating with the US, the Times reported.  But Pentagon officials, including Esper and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Gen. Mark Milley, have argued against such a move. They have said that they lacked clear evidence the March 11 attack had been ordered by Iran, the Times said. And they've cautioned that a harsher response could give rise to a wider war with Iran and further damage badly strained ties with Iraq, they warned. In the end, the US conducted its March 12 airstrikes on weapons depots. Since then, the Pentagon has taken steps to improve defenses for its troops stationed in Iraq. Last month, Gen. Kenneth McKenzie, commander of US Central Command, said for the first time that the US is moving PATRIOT missile systems into Iraq. ""We've put the preparatory materiel in place that will allow us to establish PATRIOT positions inside Iraq,"" McKenzie told reporters at the Pentagon. The US will be sending the PATRIOTs to bases in Al Asad and Irbil, and will also strengthen both places with counter-artillery and rockets systems. US troops have also consolidated into fewer bases within Iraq. The US assessment is if there is an attack against US forces, the militias as well as elements of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps would likely use a combination of rockets fired from their position inside Iraq and armed drones fired from inside Iran.  The assessment is these weapons would give plausible deniability to the attackers. It's a strategy that differs from Tehran's January 8 attack on the Al Asad base, which is used by American, Iraqi and British forces. That assault, meant to retaliate for Soleimani's January 3 killing, used ballistic missiles unique to Iran. For the last several weeks, the Pentagon has been refining an extensive package of military options for Trump if a response to Iran is required. As always, the options range from non-kinetic actions, such as potential cyber operations, to a full-scale attack against multiple targets inside Iran. "
California governor urges state leaders to issue stay-at-home orders: 'What are you waiting for?'," (CNN)California Gov. Gavin Newsom had a pointed question Wednesday for state leaders who haven't yet issued stay-at-home orders amid the novel coronavirus pandemic: ""What are you waiting for?"" Newsom, a Democrat, issued the first statewide mandatory restrictions in the United States last month, ordering California's nearly 40 million residents to stay home to help combat the outbreak. He spoke to CNN's Jake Tapper on  ""The Lead"" as the virus continues to surge across the US, with more than 210,000 people infected and at least 4,650 deaths nationwide as of Wednesday afternoon. California alone has reported at least 8,150 cases and 150 deaths. ""Our message is this: 'What are you waiting for?' "" Newsom told Tapper when asked about governors who haven't followed suit. ""What more evidence do you need? If you think it's not going to happen to you, there are many proof points all across this country; for that matter, around the rest of the world."" ""You'll never regret overcompensating at the moment so that you're preparing people for meeting this moment in the responsible way,"" he continued.  At least 30 states and the District of Columbia have ordered their residents to stay at home.  Newsom told Tapper on Wednesday that more of those orders can help ""bend the curve, can save lives and ultimately can get people back to work and get society back to some semblance of normalcy faster than anything else we can do."" That message was echoed later Wednesday by Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, another Democrat, who assessed that the US ""should have a national strategy instead of a patchwork of policies"" at the state level.  ""That's why I think it's important that we governors are leading and showing the way and being aggressive. I'm grateful that I have great, you know, colleagues here in the Midwest in particular. We've been pretty aggressive as a geography and I think that's important,"" Whitmer told CNN''s Anderson Cooper on ""AC360."" ""But without a national strategy, without a uniform policy, this is going to go on longer than it needs to and more lives are going to be lost, more than we otherwise would,"" she added.  On Tuesday, President Donald Trump warned of a ""painful"" and ""tough"" two-week stretch ahead as he extended nationwide distancing measures that -- even if followed closely -- could still mean more than 100,000 and up to 240,000 Americans die in the pandemic.  ""I want every American to be prepared for the hard days that lie ahead. We're going to go through a very tough two weeks,"" Trump said during a news briefing, setting expectations for a dire fortnight where death rates spike. It was a stark message from a President who had spent weeks downplaying the severity of the virus and who has lashed out at several Democratic governors responding to the crisis.  In turn, the President has garnered intense criticism from scores of governors over a lack of federal assistance. Several struggling states are becoming increasingly desperate to obtain needed medical supplies to outfit health care workers on the front lines of the fight against the pandemic. Newsom on Wednesday stressed the need to ""raise above the partisanship"" during ""times of crisis."" ""I've extended always an open hand, not a closed fist, in those circumstances and this is no different. But let me just be candid with you: I'd be lying to you to say that he hasn't been responsive to our needs,"" Newsom said of the President.  ""Every time I've called the President, he's quickly gotten on the line."" "
Last rounds of protective gear in national stockpile being shipped," (CNN)The Strategic National Stockpile is deploying the last round of shipments in its inventory, depleting the bulk of its protective gear, according to a source familiar with the matter.CNN's Geneva Sands and Jason Hoffman contributed to this report. The official added that the stockpile was never meant to serve as the only source of protective gear for the entire coronavirus response and said the states would need to get more supply from the private market. The official stressed that the stockpile, which is managed by the Department of Health and Human Services, will never be completely depleted as they always retain a small percentage for the most critical needs.  On Wednesday, President Donald Trump acknowledged that the stockpile is nearly depleted. ""It is. We are sending it directly to hospitals,"" Trump said. He added, ""We have asked states where they have large manufacturers of different types of equipment to use those local factories, local plants, and have it made directly, ship it right into the hospitals."" Since the start of the pandemic, officials have been sounding the alarm that there was never going to be enough gear for a 50-state response. On Tuesday, President Donald Trump said the government would hold onto 10,000 ventilators to ensure the government had the ability to deploy quickly if they need the units in the future. According to one source familiar with the Federal Emergency Management Agency's role in procuring resources, the agency is assessing what is needed and what supplies are available across the globe. FEMA has begun chartering flights with critical supplies from across the world and facilitating the distribution to hotspots and the private sector.  FEMA said in a statement that the agency's planning for the Covid-19 pandemic response ""acknowledged that the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) alone could not fulfill all requirements at the State and tribal level. Therefore, as the Vice President stated last night, the federal government will exhaust all means to identify and attain medical and other supplies needed to combat the virus."" A Department of Homeland Security official told CNN the stockpile is ""near depletion because the numbers are low."" ""When you see demand is outpacing supply, then we go to the people (states) who are asking for equipment and ask if they are exhausting all of their sources,"" the official said. ""We are having to balance places that don't have any (personal protective equipment), versus someone on the verge, but not there yet."" "
Trump spreads optimism for potential coronavirus drugs while public health officials cautiously wait for proof,"Washington (CNN)There is a glaring messaging gap between President Donald Trump and top public health officials regarding medicines being used to treat coronavirus. While Trump touts them as miracle drugs that are on the brink of saving lives, experts are cautiously waiting for scientific evidence.CNN's Elizabeth Cohen, Brynn Gingras and Tara Subramaniam contributed to this article. This dynamic has played out over the past few weeks, and was on full display again during the White House briefing on Tuesday. Trump said the drugs might be a ""total game-changer"" and implied that good news from clinical trials was just days away, only to be corrected by the nation's top infectious disease expert, who steered clear of glowing superlatives and said the research will take months, ""at very best."" The medicines -- chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine -- have been used for decades to fight malaria. But this week, the Food and Drug Administration granted emergency authorization for doctors to use them to treat Covid-19 in hospitalized patients. This was the first step in getting millions of pills to the states, though hospitals have been using the drugs for coronavirus without explicit government approval for weeks. Even in making this landmark announcement, the Department of Health and Human Services simultaneously gave a tempered assessment of the potential benefits. A press release said, ""anecdotal reports suggest that these drugs may offer some benefit"" in coronavirus patients, but ""clinical trials are needed to provide scientific evidence that these treatments are effective."" That tone is entirely different from what the President has been saying at daily briefings. Millions of stuck-at-home Americans watched him claim that the drugs have ""tremendous promise"" and ""could be a game changer,"" and that they are ""very effective"" and ""can be taken safely."" Trump went even further on Tuesday, falsely suggesting that the drugs have already been proven safe. ""Very powerful drug, but it's been out there for a long time,"" he said at the daily White House coronavirus briefing. ""So, it's tested in the sense that you know it doesn't kill you."" Doctors say he's wrong, and that comments like these could have deadly consequences. A man in Arizona died after ingesting a form of chloroquine used to treat aquariums. There have been at least three overdoses in Nigeria as well. There are reports of hoarding by doctors and shortages, where people with lupus and other diseases who also use the drugs can't get them. ""As the dose of chloroquine goes up, it goes from being safe and effective to highly toxic, quickly,"" said Dr. Christopher Plowe, a renowned malaria expert at the Duke Global Health Institute. ""It's very easy to overdose on chloroquine. You get above the ceiling of safety pretty quickly. There are some very serious risks here. There's quite a bit to lose, including your life."" Experts like Plowe who study these drugs, and doctors who are prescribing them, agree with the public health officials that clinical trials will tell whether Trump's optimism is well-placed.  Testing is underway, including a large study in New York, the epicenter of the US outbreak with more than 75,000 cases, the most of any state in the country. New York public health authorities have obtained at least 1 million doses of hydroxychloroquine, which will be used for a large-scale clinical trial, an official at the New York State Department of Health told CNN.   Other states, like Michigan, are still asking the Trump administration for their share of the drugs. The pharmaceutical giant Novartis recently donated 30 million hydroxychloroquine tablets to the federal government as part of the new push to get the drug to patients who need it. Asked if the company agrees with Trump's view that the drugs might be the most significant breakthrough in modern medicine, a spokeswoman told CNN, ""We believe you need to follow the science."" Optimism versus science French researchers published a small study on March 17, suggesting that hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine were effective against the coronavirus. The results were met with caution: Public health officials noted that the research was conducted by a controversial doctor, it only included 24 patients, didn't follow typical rules for randomized trials, and was not peer-reviewed. Regardless, within 48 hours, Trump sprang into action and began touting the study and the drugs, and has done so at least a dozen times in two weeks, according to a CNN analysis. The medical community immediately noticed the disconnect between Trump's posture and the science. A stark headline from The New York Times read, ""Trump's Embrace of Unproven Drugs to Treat Coronavirus Defies Science."" Science Magazine, a peer-reviewed academic journal, ran a similar piece quoting a leading Australian medical researcher who said, ""this is insane!"" Senior Trump administration officials and public health experts followed suit, partially walking back Trump's comments with their own tempered takes, often from the very same podium. When a journalist asked Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, if these medicines could prevent Covid-19, Fauci gave a crystal-clear response: ""The answer is no."" Dr. Deborah Birx, the response coordinator for the White House's coronavirus task force, said, ""We're trying to figure out how many anecdotal reports equal real scientific breakthrough,"" when asked about the drugs. The FDA Commissioner, Dr. Stephen Hahn, said a ""large, pragmatic clinical trial"" is still needed to ""actually gather that information and answer the question that needs to be answered,"" as to whether the drugs are effective and safe to use during the worsening coronavirus pandemic. A little-noticed Pentagon report, written by military doctors and released amid Trump's barrage of optimism, said, ""(Bottom line up front): No high-quality evidence exists to support use at present."" The 51-page report of best practices, which has been circulating among American physicians, warned that the drugs have toxic side effects and can lead to cardiac complications.  The report said more research is needed to corroborate the French study. If those early results are accurate, ""this would be the first time chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine was found to be effective for the clinical management of a viral infection,"" the report said, because previous clinical trials determined that the drugs had no impact on other viruses like influenza and HIV. Balancing benefits and risks Senior public health officials like Fauci and Hahn have said Trump wants to strike an optimistic tone to keep hope alive among Americans who are worried about their health and their paycheck. But there are risks, both to public health and in the presidential campaign unfolding in the background, in over-promising when it comes to things like drug treatments during an epidemic.  ""Medical history has so many examples of treatments that people had good experiences with, and people got better, and they had great confidence in the treatment, and years later when a randomized trial was done, it turned out no better than placebo,"" said Plowe, the Duke expert. Even with that uncertainty, some doctors on the frontlines say there aren't many other options. Former Kansas Gov. Jeff Colyer, now a surgeon in the Kansas City area who is treating patients with Covid-19, applauded the FDA's decision to let hospitals use the anti-malaria drugs, which he promoted in two columns in The Wall Street Journal and interviews with Fox News hosts. ""The FDA made a difficult decision, but they were right,"" Colyer told CNN. ""We won't have all the hard data we want for months. But at this point, this is one of the most promising treatments out there. We need to understand all these drugs better, but we're in a unique situation."" Before the pandemic, the Trump administration named Colyer chairman of the National Advisory Committee on Rural Health, within the Department of Health and Human Services. Colyer, a Republican, told CNN he is informally advising the Trump administration on the virus.  Regardless of Trump's glowing rhetoric about the medicines, Colyer said the FDA ""made a finding after reviewing all the literature"" that is available, even though the research is limited. ""They've seen the plusses and the minuses and made a professional decision,"" he added. "
"Calling the fight against coronavirus a ""war"" can motivate but also mislead"," (CNN)Donald Trump has called himself a ""wartime president"" and said coronavirus is an ""invisible enemy."" The former CDC director has warned of a ""long war ahead."" New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has called on the public to support our ""troops,"" otherwise known as health care workers. CNN's Barbara Starr and Ryan Browne contributed to this report. The now-common metaphors comparing the efforts to stop coronavirus to a military war fit smoothly in many ways. Like in war, a pandemic has life-and-death decisions, an ""enemy"" who can strike at any time, ""battles"" on the ""front lines"" and calls for the ""home front"" to support the effort. ""People understand what a war means, what the consequences of a war mean in terms of pain and loss and death,"" said Dr. Leana Wen, a visiting professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University Milken School of Public Health. ""They understand the sacrifices that have to occur during wartime and they understand the massive mobilization of resources needed in a war."" Still, the fight to stop coronavirus is of course not actually a war between countries -- it is a global public health emergency. War metaphors can help inform and motivate the public, but they can also mislead policymakers and the public. ""When in a war, you're killing people and you've got an enemy. I understand the need to make the virus into the enemy,"" said Dr. Larry Brilliant, an epidemiologist who helped to eradicate smallpox. ""There's a harm to it. When you are in a war, the only thing you do is the war. We have a lot of other things we do."" The power of war metaphors The primary reason officials use war metaphors is to convey a sense of urgency and emergency. Like with the ""War on Poverty"" or the ""War on Drugs,"" the idea is to turn an issue into the issue. ""It has a focusing effect that saying 'this is a public health crisis' would not,"" said Juliette Kayyem, a CNN national security analyst and faculty chair of the Global Health and Security Project at the Harvard Kennedy School. ""This truly gets to our safety and security as a nation just as a war would, just as an enemy invading our shores would. It's helpful for people seeing it that way and mobilizing people in that fight."" The war metaphor also shows the need for everyone to mobilize and do their part on the home front. For many Americans, that means taking social distancing orders and hand washing recommendations seriously. For businesses, that means shifting resources toward stopping the outbreak, whether in terms of supplies or manpower. ""You're reaching for some way to think about the vast challenge we're facing and the need to mobilize for success,"" said Dr. Josh Sharfstein, the vice dean for public health practice and community engagement at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. ""The need to mobilize is so great and impacts so much of our lives that I think it's only 'war' -- it's a way to try to capture that everybody has to do their part."" Further, the war metaphors can explain complicated ideas in understandable terms. Kayyem, for example, said that the failure to provide health care workers with enough personal protective equipment, or PPE, is like going to war without ammunition. Some doctors have described hospitals overrun by coronavirus as ""war zones"" to explain the extent of the daily pain, despair and suffering. Finally, politicians have used the war analogy to try to cut through partisan disagreements and unite people against a common enemy. ""The president said this is a war,"" Cuomo said Monday. ""I agree with that. This is a war. Then let's act that way, and let's act that way now. And let's show a commonality and a mutuality and a unity that this country has not seen in decades, because the Lord knows we need it today more than ever before."" The flaws of war metaphors But the war metaphors do have drawbacks. In particular, the patriotism that comes with war language often leads to country-specific decisions that are antithetical to solving a pandemic, which is by definition a global issue. ""Everyone in the world will get this virus unless protected by immunity, or (they already) got the disease, or by quarantine and social distancing,"" Brilliant said. ""Therefore, you and I are as much at risk by someone in a slum in Nairobi getting the disease as someone in New York City. Because ultimately it will ping-pong back to us."" ""You have to look at problems in other countries as if they are our problem only different in time. Even if we cleared out every case in the United States right now by social distancing we would remain vulnerable as long as there's a case anywhere in the world. This is not a time to emotionally close our borders to the rest of the world."" The World Health Organization, for example, has advised against closing any country's borders or limiting international travel.  ""In general, evidence shows that restricting the movement of people and goods during public health emergencies is ineffective in most situations and may divert resources from other interventions,"" WHO said. Dr. Wen noted that the need for global cooperation was one area in which the war comparison does not quite fit. ""One difference in this case is all of us on the planet are united against this virus. Each of our fates are tied to each other, but in a different way than in a war,"" she said. ""What's good for one person is good for everybody else."" Separately, the war language can displace blame. President Trump has portrayed coronavirus as a surprise attack, but public health experts have been warning about stockpiling supplies and coordinating strategies for a pandemic for years. ""For people in public health this is not out of the blue,"" said Cheryl Healton, the dean of the NYU School of Global Public Health. The war metaphor ""makes it seem like it was something you couldn't control. War is like a last resort. There were many other alternatives to this."" Healton also said war-like language can lead to short-term solutions that ignore underlying issues. ""The problem with the word war is it's too acute and makes it sound like it just kind of happened and we can fix it quickly and move on, as opposed to what happened is from systemic problems that need to be reformed so they don't happen again,"" she said. She said government funding has long focused on treatment rather than prevention -- the equivalent of preparing for war but ignoring diplomacy. The war metaphors can create political opportunities for authoritarians, too. The idea of a nation under attack can be used by authoritarian leaders to seize more power, such as what already happened in Hungary or in the Philippines. As for America's actual military, its troops are as vulnerable to coronavirus as anyone else. For example, at least 70 sailors aboard the USS Theodore Roosevelt, a US Navy aircraft carrier, have coronavirus, and the ship's commander has warned Navy leadership that decisive action is required to save the crew. ""We are not at war,"" Capt. Brett Crozier wrote in a memo to the Navy's Pacific Fleet, three US defense officials have confirmed to CNN. ""Sailors do not need to die."" "
"Zoom, the video conferencing app everyone is using, faces questions over privacy"," (CNN Business)The coronavirus outbreak has seen millions of people ordered to stay in their homes flock to Zoom, using the video conference app for everything from brunches and birthday parties to religious events and even a UK cabinet meeting. But the spike in popularity is leading to a wave of scrutiny, particularly around privacy.  While video chat apps in general have seen a surge in usage, including Microsoft's (MSFT) Skype and Teams platforms and Cisco's Webex, Zoom (ZM) has emerged as the go-to contender thanks to its ability to host a large number of users — up to 100 in the free version — and fun social features such as customizable photo backgrounds. The company's stock price has nearly doubled in the past two months.   But that surge in growth and the company's widespread usage have surfaced several concerns. In the last week alone, issues with Zoom's privacy protections have been flagged by users, security researchers and US authorities. The increased attention highlights a new front in the global debate over privacy and security as a result of the global pandemic, as millions of people adapt to working remotely and using technology that could potentially expose their data.  New York Attorney General Letitia James sent a letter to Zoom on Monday asking whether the company ""is taking appropriate steps to ensure users' privacy and security,"" a spokesman for James's office told CNN Business. In a statement, Zoom said it would address James's questions. ""Zoom takes its users' privacy, security, and trust extremely seriously,"" a spokesperson for the company said in a statement. ""During the COVID-19 pandemic, we are working around-the-clock to ensure that hospitals, universities, schools, and other businesses across the world can stay connected and operational.  We appreciate the New York Attorney General's engagement on these issues and are happy to provide her with the requested information."" On Monday, the FBI issued a warning against ""Zoom-bombing,"" where hackers or trolls hijack a public video call. The agency cited examples of users entering meetings or virtual classrooms to shout profanities and share pornography. The FBI urged victims of ""teleconference hijacking"" to report any incidents to the agency.  Zoom founder and CEO Eric Yuan addressed some of those issues in a tweet on Friday, saying they stem from users not enabling some security features such as meeting passwords and additional privacy controls.  ""We will enforce these settings in addition to training and blogs,"" he said.  A Zoom spokesperson said the company was ""deeply upset to hear about the incidents involving this type of attack.""  Users hosting large public meetings should review their settings to make sure only the hosts can share their screen, and activate additional privacy controls, the spokesperson added. ""We also recently updated the default screen sharing settings for our education users so teachers by default are the only ones who can share content in class.""  Founded nine years ago, Zoom has found itself suddenly become a vital social and professional lifeline for millions around the world. But that rapid growth has led to it already being hit by the kind of controversies that far larger tech companies like Facebook (FB) and Google (GOOGL) frequently grapple with.  ""They've gone from interesting new startup product to part of the global infrastructure in days. And I think the many gaps in maturity are becoming painfully clear,"" Jules Polonetsky, CEO of the Future of Privacy Forum and the former chief privacy officer of AOL, told CNN Business in an interview. ""Some of them range from just stupid stuff that maybe doesn't create risk to most users, to other things that are going to create legal liability for them."" Another recent issue, first reported by Motherboard, involves Zoom's sharing of user data with Facebook. Zoom originally allowed users to log into its iOS app using their Facebook accounts, but the feature it was using to do so shared details with Facebook about the user's device, including its timezone, language, model number and IP address. (Facebook offers the tool to any developer to integrate with their apps.) The revelation led to two Zoom users separately filing class action lawsuits against the company in a Northern California district court this week, with one suit alleging that the video app ""has failed to safeguard the personal information of the increasing millions of users of its software"" and the other claiming it gave them ""no opportunity to express or withhold consent to Zoom's misconduct."" The lawsuits accuse Zoom of collecting users' personal information and sharing it with third parties, including Facebook, without properly notifying the users.  Zoom declined to comment on the lawsuits, but directed CNN Business to a recent blog post in which it says it removed the code that allows the data sharing with Facebook to occur. Facebook did not respond to a request for comment.  Some security experts have expressed doubts about Zoom's claim that it offers ""end-to-end encryption for all meetings.""  Instead, Zoom uses something called transport encryption, which only secures the message while it's en route from a video chat to the company's servers, according to David Kennedy, founder of cybersecurity firm TrustedSec and a former cyberwarfare specialist with the United States Marine Corps. That means Zoom effectively functions as a middleman in all video conversations on its platform and has access to those conversations, he said.  A report by The Intercept first identified the shortcoming.  Zoom did not respond to multiple requests for comment on its encryption. The company released an update to its privacy policy over the weekend, stressing that it ""collects only the data from individuals using the Zoom platform required to provide the service and ensure it is delivered effectively.""  The Zoom spokesperson acknowledged that the company collects ""basic technical information"" such as IP addresses and device details, but stressed that it has strict privacy controls to protect against unauthorized access.  ""Importantly, Zoom does not sell user data of any kind to anyone,"" the spokesperson added.  Without end-to-end encryption on video, Kennedy says video conversations on Zoom could technically be accessed and stored by the company.  ""Zoom doesn't seem to be very clear on what they record, what they don't record,"" he said. ""There's a lot of things that Zoom is doing that is particularly alarming and concerning, because they're not using the right language and terminology."" "
Gun retailers deemed 'essential service' by federal government,"Washington, DC (CNN)As states around the country issue ""stay-at-home"" orders amid the coronavirus pandemic, firearm and ammunition retailers have been designated an ""essential service,"" according to updated guidance from the federal government.   Christopher Krebs, director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, identified ""firearm and ammunition product manufacturers, retailers, importers, distributors, and shooting ranges"" as critical infrastructure in the updated ""Essential Critical Infrastructure Workforce"" advisory, which was issued over the weekend.  The list is intended to be advisory and not to be considered ""the exclusive list of critical infrastructure sectors, workers, and functions that should continue during the Covid-19 response across all jurisdictions.""  ""Individual jurisdictions should add or subtract essential workforce categories based on their own requirements and discretion,"" the advisory states. The Covid-19 health crisis has prompted at least 30 states and the District of Columbia to issue stay-at-home orders that force the closure of ""non-essential services."" Firearm retailers haven't been specifically mentioned in some states' lists of essential businesses, so they're assumed to be non-essential. The new guidance is being hailed as a victory by leading national gun rights groups like the Second Amendment Foundation and the Firearms Policy Coalition, who had already filed a series of lawsuits in places like New Jersey and California challenging stay-at-home orders that didn't specifically designate firearm retailers as an ""essential service."" ""The president and his administration have done the right thing,"" SAF founder and Executive Vice President Alan Gottlieb said in a press release. ""They are dealing with a national emergency while remembering that no malady, however severe, can nullify or even temporarily suspend the exercise of a constitutionally delineated fundamental right."" The new guidance led to New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, announcing on Monday an updated list of permitted businesses during the stay-at-home order to include firearms retailers by appointment only and during limited hours. Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva issued a similar order Monday, the second time he has deemed gun stores as an essential business after ordering them closed last week. Gottlieb told CNN that SAF is still looking at Vermont, New Mexico and New York as possible ""targets"" for lawsuits if they don't update their essential business list.   ""We don't have a problem with governor's stay-at-home orders in any of these states and we are for measures like social distancing...but we are not happy and what we won't put up with, is the closing of gun manufacturers and gun retailers,"" Gottlieb told CNN.   The National Rifle Association is now keeping track of all the emergency orders and their possible effect on gun rights. In a Twitter post last week, the NRA said ""gun-grabbing politicians are exploiting this pandemic to strip you of your rights.""  Gun sales surging as virus case count grows As of the first week of April, there were more than 200,000 cases of coronavirus in the United States across all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands. Deaths from Covid-19 have topped 4,400 in the country, as the US struggles to contain the virus's reach. As the pandemic is unfolding, gun sellers across the country are reporting a surge in firearm and bullet purchases.  These purchases have been tracked to an increase in the search term ""coronavirus"" according to the ammunition website Ammo.com which said it has recorded an unprecedented surge in bullet sales since February 23 when the term gained traction online.  Administrators for the site, which ships ammunition to all but four states across the nation, released sales figures on Friday showing a 350% increase in website visits between Feb. 23 to March 26 compared to the previous 32 day time period. Meanwhile, revenue has increased 777%, according to the site, which said coronavirus fears are fueling the sales surge.  Read CNN's Chris Cillizza analysis on the growing gun sales across the country ""We know certain things impact ammo sales, mostly political events or economic instability when people feel their rights may end up infringed, but this is our first experience with a virus leading to such a boost in sales,"" said Alex Horsman, spokesman for Ammo.com in an email to CNN. ""It makes sense. A lot of our customers like to be prepared. And for many of them, it's not just facemasks and TheraFlu. It's knowing that no matter what happens, they can keep themselves and their families safe,"" Horsman added. "
Coronavirus has police everywhere scrambling to respond as their forces are reduced," (CNN)Serving and trying to protect against a threat we can't see, law enforcement officials around the country are grappling with policing during the coronavirus pandemic.CNN's Jim Sciutto and Elizabeth Joseph contributed to this report. Big departments such as in New York or Detroit are shifting resources and people around to ensure essential work gets done as their workforces are reduced by the virus. Sheriffs' offices around the country are trying to reduce their jail populations to protect their employees and inmates, the Police Executive Research Forum (PERF) reported. In New York, where there are more than 47,000 cases of Covid-19, the country's largest police force had 17% of its force -- more than 6,000 people -- out sick as of Wednesday, and 1,400 of its force has tested positive for the virus. The mayor of Detroit said about 20% of its police force was under quarantine.  Although police officers are ""trained and diligent in dealing with the unknown,"" the pandemic is unlike anything he's seen in his 43 years of policing, Detroit Police Chief James Craig told CNN. ""I've been through civil unrest, I've been through earthquakes in Los Angeles,"" said Craig, who has the virus himself. ""There is nothing that can compare to this."" As in many other police departments across the United States, those in the NYPD who can are working from home, but many are still out on the streets, delivering groceries to the elderly and even, as was the case recently in the Bronx, delivering babies, New York Police Department Commissioner Dermot Shea said.  ""I can tell you we''re in good shape despite so many people going down with this sickness,"" Shea said in a Q&A session online Tuesday. ""We're in good shape because everyone is pitching in."" Some precincts are minimally staffed, Shea said, and if it goes below the minimum, ""We have people ready to backfill there,"" Shea said.  ""We're not close to 12-hour tours yet, but if we have to, we'll do it,"" the commissioner said. Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Wednesday the city's police department is so large that even with the number of positive coronavirus cases confirmed within the force, New Yorkers will be protected. And if needed, state police will step in as backfill. The state would also consider deputizing police officers from upstate communities to serve in New York City ""if we get to that point,"" Cuomo said.  Agencies have told PERF that losing their communications systems is one of their biggest fears in this crisis. In Detroit, the department's communication system ""had an impact,"" but they were able to use a backup, Craig told CNN Tuesday.  Faced with a reduced force, Detroit has ""collapsed some of our nonessential units,"" moving them to ""our hardest-hit stations so that they could continue to do the most important work"" of answering emergency calls. ""We've done that very well,"" Craig said,  Police departments and sheriff's offices are reporting a decrease in crime overall as people across the nation are hunkered down at home.  ""Crime has dropped off -- off the face of the map, really,"" Shea said. And while 911 calls are skyrocketing in places such as New York, the number actually funneled to the NYPD are down, Shea said. ""Those two factors are really kind of pulling us along through this crisis,"" Shea said. Some agencies are reporting an increase in domestic disputes and assaults, driving under the influence and disorderly conduct. In St. Mary's County, Maryland, ""calls for service in general are down significantly,"" but disorderly conduct calls are up 300%, Sheriff Tim Cameron told PERF. ""The disorderly conduct calls are things like grocery stores that have a limit on how many rolls of toilet paper you can buy, and it becomes a situation,"" Cameron told PERF.  Police departments and sheriff's offices say they're working to protect their forces by reducing in-person responses to calls, limiting them to emergency and high-priority situations.  They're also trying to keep their jail population sizes down by not making arrests for low-level crimes, and working with district attorneys and judges to determine whether a person really needs to be jailed right now. In Hennepin County, Minnesota, the sheriff's office is even willing to pay a state-required bail if necessary to keep a person out of its custody. ""If it's a matter of a state-required $78 bail, we'll pay the $78 to get them out of there and have them come back at some later time,"" Rob Allen, the sheriff's office chief of staff, told PERF. As the crisis wears on, law enforcement leaders say some in their ranks who tested positive are now back at work. As of Tuesday, 17 had returned to work at the NYPD since Friday, Shea said. ""They're back, they're better, and they're jumping in to fill the place where others go down,"" Shea said. "
Dolly Parton donates $1 million toward coronavirus research," (CNN)Dolly Parton, no one can hold a candle to you.  ❤️A post shared by  Dolly Parton (@dollyparton) on Apr 1, 2020 at 9:24am PDT The legendary performer on Wednesday announced she was making a $1 million donation to Vanderbilt University's coronavirus research.  ""My longtime friend Dr. Naji Abumrad, who's been involved in research at Vanderbilt for many years, informed me that they were making some exciting advancements towards research of the coronavirus for a cure,"" she wrote in a statement posted to Instagram.  Parton is one of many celebrities making sizable donations towards worthy causes amid the global pandemic.  Rihanna's The Clara Lionel Foundation and Jay-Z's Shawn Carter Foundation each donated $1 million to coronavirus response efforts this week.  Last week, Kylie Jenner donated $1 million to buy personal protective equipment for health-care workers, and Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively gave $1 million to two food charities. ""We are incredibly grateful to Dolly (@DollyParton) for believing in our doctors and researchers as we work hard to fight COVID-19,"" Vanderbilt University Medical Center said in a statement, which also provided a donation link.

Illinois becoming desperate for federal government to send medical supplies to fight coronavirus," (CNN)The state of Illinois is desperate to receive medical supplies to fight the coronavirus outbreak but the Trump administration is barely providing the state with anything, a senior state official told CNN on Wednesday.CNN's Caroline Kelly and Eric Bradner contributed to this report. Referring to ""Project Airbridge"" -- an airlift of supplies provided by the federal government and private health care distributors and helmed by White House senior adviser and President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner -- the official said that ""the Airbridge that Trump and (Vice President Mike) Pence talk about coming to Illinois -- all the goods went to other states. We got nothing."" Illinois is one of several states struggling to obtain needed medical supplies to outfit health care workers on the front lines of the fight against the pandemic. Governors across the country have complained about having to bid against each other for medical supplies shipments and some, such as Michigan Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, have said contractors are canceling contracts in order to sell medical supplies to the federal government instead of the states. Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, a Democrat, has been up front with his complaints about the process, telling CNN's Chris Cuomo on Tuesday that the state has ""gotten about 10% of what we asked for"" from the federal government. On Tuesday, Pence noted that he spoke with Pritzker and said, ""In the last week and in the week ahead, more than 450 ventilators"" would be headed to Illinois.  But the Illinois official told CNN that the request had actually been filled more than a week ago, and the state's total request was for 4,000 ventilators.  ""They had sent us, 10 days ago, 450 of our 4,000 ventilator request,"" the official said. ""They are not sending any more."" The Trump administration had also said that it had sent Illinois 300,000 N95 masks, which is what doctors wear when treating individuals infected with a virus. The state had requested 1.7 million. ""But actually,"" the official told CNN, ""they sent us 300,000 general/medical masks.""  Those masks are not considered respiratory protection by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and are not totally effective in preventing coronavirus transmission. The official added, ""We are just not counting on anything and are likely not to be able to procure what we need in ventilators by the time we hit peak later this month."" Pritzker said at a news conference on Monday that the shipment of personal protective equipment was the third that Illinois has received from the federal government, and it arrived Sunday.  Pritzker said that in its first request several weeks ago, the state asked for over 1.2 million N95 masks, 900,000 surgical masks, 1.6 million gloves, 24,000 gowns, 24,000 goggles, 120,000 face shields and 4,000 respirators -- but received ""a fraction"" of that, as it did with its second, larger request. Pritzker also called on Trump to use the Defense Production Act to direct companies increase personal protective equipment production. Trump invoked the act on Friday to require General Motors to produce more ventilators to deal with increased hospitalizations. ""I can't emphasize enough how much we need the federal government to step up and amplify the size of their (personal protective equipment) deliveries to Illinois and, frankly, across the nation,"" Pritzker added. "
Public's habits and coronavirus expectations have changed significantly in the last few weeks," (CNN)A new poll shows a majority of Americans are self-isolating and nearly all of them are concerned about the novel coronavirus pandemic -- and fewer than half trust the federal government to do the right thing. Overall, 92% of Americans are concerned about the coronavirus outbreak, according to an Ipsos/Axios poll released Wednesday. A majority now say they are self-isolating, and the share who say they have at least a fair amount of trust in the federal government to look out for the best interests of their family has dropped below 50%. A majority of Americans (53%) now say they've self-quarantined, described in the survey as ""stay[ing] at home and avoid[ing] contact with others for 14 days."" That's up from 10% who said so two weeks ago and 39% last week. One of the biggest increases is among those over the age of 65 -- almost two-thirds of that group are self-quarantining, up from only 11% said so in mid-March. Nearly a third of Americans (31%) report that their ability to access health care has gotten worse in the last week, up from 25% last week and 9% two weeks ago. About a quarter now (24%) say their ability to protect the health of their household has also gotten worse in the past week.  Almost 9 in 10 Americans say they know what to do if they were to feel sick and suspect they have the virus. Only 1 in 10 say they know someone with coronavirus, but that's more than doubled from the 4% who said so two weeks ago. And 1 in 10 say they tried to get tested for coronavirus themselves, but were turned away. That's up from 5% two weeks ago.  The tracking poll has measured the public's views on and response to the coronavirus outbreak in each of the last three weeks, with the results showing the swift change in American life over that time. The poll finds abrupt changes in behavior after recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and others.  The share who say they canceled travel plans rose from 30% in the first week of the poll to 48% now. The share saying they canceled or skipped large gatherings climbed from 46% in the first week to 73% now. Just 13% say they dined out in the last week, down from 56% in the first week of the poll, and only 23% say they have visited with friends and family, down from 48% two weeks ago. Amid increased self-isolation, half of people have had a video call with friends or family, while 21% have attended a large gathering via online streaming or social media such as birthday parties, book clubs, religious services or happy hours, and 12% have attended an online exercise class.  A sizable minority (37%) say their emotional well-being has worsened, up from 29% who said so two weeks ago.  And 30% say their mental health has gotten worse in the last week, down from 35% in the week prior but still above the 22% who felt that way at the start of the tracking poll. A smaller 14% say their physical health has worsened in the last week, up from 8% in the first week of the poll. About half of Americans are worried about their ability to pay bills or their job security, as the survey finds dramatic changes in the ways people are working. About 4 in 10 (42%) of employed Americans have been told to work remotely, up from 21% who said so two weeks ago, and 43% say it has become harder to do their jobs in the last few weeks. Two in 10 have been temporarily furloughed or suspended while 16% say their employers have shut down their place or work entirely.  The poll looked at how the changes in employment are affecting people of different classes, which were defined by using an index based on individuals' income and educational attainment. It found that 1 in 5 middle class Americans say their company has closed or they have been furloughed, which is also true of 19% of lower-middle class Americans and 15% of lower class Americans.  Those figures drop among upper-middle or upper class Americans. Around half of those in the upper-middle class say they are working from home, as are 39% of those in the upper class, compared with just 17% of those in the middle class, 11% in the lower-middle, and 3% in the lower class.  This Axios/Ipsos Poll was conducted March 27-30 online among 1,355 adults who are members of Ipsos' KnowledgePanel. Overall results have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 2.8 percentage points. "
Florida governor: We'll take state residents only from Zaandam cruise ship," (CNN)A pair of cruise ships carrying more than 200 guests and crew with flu-like symptoms, including eight passengers who tested positive for Covid-19, were expected off Florida's coast early Thursday.CNN's Jennifer Henderson contributed to this report.  But whether passengers will be allowed to disembark remained unclear.    Calling the plight of those on board a ""humanitarian situation,"" Holland America ON Wednesday evening made a last-ditch appeal to federal and local authorities to allow the Zaandam and Rotterdam cruise ships to disembark in Fort Lauderdale's Port of Everglades. ""We appreciate the support of President Trump in resolving the humanitarian plight of our guests,"" the British-American cruise line said in a statement. ""Holland America Line calls for compassion and reason in the review and approval of our disembarkation plan by Florida officials."" The appeal came hours after Gov. Ron DeSantis said his state was willing to accept Floridians on board the cruise ships. ""My concern is that we have worked so hard to make sure we have adequate hospital space in the event of a Covid-19 surge, we wouldn't want those valuable beds to be taken because of the cruise ship,"" DeSantis said.  There are 808 guests and 583 crew on the Rotterdam and 442 guests and 603 crew on the Zaandam, according to Holland America. There are 311 American citizens, including 52 Floridians.  DeSantis expressed concerns about taking in others given the state's limited hospital beds. ""We are going to be willing to accept Floridians on board,"" he told reporters. ""My understanding is most of the passengers are foreign nationals."" The cruise line said 97 guests and 136 crew on the ships have flu-like symptoms. The ill passengers would stay isolated on board until they recover. Holland America said it had secured a local health system to treat the fewer than 10 people in need of immediate critical care onshore. ""This small number is the only group that will require any support from medical resources in Broward County and is necessary to prevent further harm to their health,"" the cruise line statement said. Nearly 1,200 guests are fit to travel home, per CDC guidelines, according to the cruise line, which suggested those travelers could catch flights home after disembarking. The guests would be transported in sanitized coaches with limited person-to-person contact and masks. The governor has said there is about 30% hospital bed availability in Florida, where two field hospitals have been set up in Miami-Dade and Broward counties. Trump on Tuesday night said he had planned to discuss the situation with DeSantis. ""People are dying on the ship, or at least very sick, but they are dying on the ship,"" Trump said. ""So, I'm going to do what is right."" Fort Lauderdale's mayor said he planned to meet Wednesday with Holland America's CEO to discuss a possible solution.  ""We want these ill people to find immediate medical assistance,"" Mayor Dean Trantalis told CNN. ""We have to be comfortable knowing that they're being quarantined in such a way they don't infect the rest of the community."" The Zaandam, on which four guests have died since it departed Argentina's capital March 7, is among more than a dozen cruise ships stranded at sea as ports deny entry and passengers panic about returning home. ""We were not against the ships docking in our community,"" Trantalis said. ""The problem is that no protocol has been established yet to allow these folks to come off the ship. We are in a midst of a humanitarian crisis here."" US Coast Guard says foreign vessels were straining medical resources  Officials at the Port of Everglades said Holland America must have an approved docking and disembarking plan before its ships can enter US waters. US Sen. Rick Scott of Florida has said every Zaandam passenger must be quarantined for 14 days. ""We have to ensure the sick are getting properly treated, but we can't take any chances,"" he said in a statement this week. The Zaandam began transiting the Panama Canal late Sunday after being docked off Panama for several days. The boat and its occupants have been in limbo for weeks awaiting permission to disembark after several South American ports denied the ship's entry. ""We have to be able to allow people to step off the ship and be able to return to families, whether in Florida, anywhere in this country or anywhere around the world,"" Trantalis said Wednesday. ""But we cannot do it willy-nilly. We have to be sure we're taking precautions."" The US Coast Guard, in a marine safety information bulletin issued Sunday, said an increase in foreign passenger vessels requiring medical evacuations was straining local medical resources.  Passengers have ""better access to comfortable surroundings and medical staff on board the foreign passenger vessel where care is already being provided,"" according to the bulletin.  ""This is necessary as shore-side medical facilities may reach full capacity and lose the ability to accept and effectively treat additional critically-ill patients,"" the bulletin said. Jennifer Allan said her mother, Gloria Weed, 70, and father, Bill Weed, 75, have been quarantined in their cabin aboard the Zaandam in what she described as ""solitary confinement.""  ""My dad has developed pneumonia,"" she told CNN this week. ""He's getting worse. They need to get to land. They need to get medical attention sooner rather than later."" Allan said her parents, who live in Sarasota, Florida, came down with a fever about 10 days ago. She described the efforts of the Zaandam crew members to care for passengers as ""extraordinary"" even though many are themselves sick.  No one has left the ship since it stopped in Punta Arenas, Chile, on March 14. Guests were originally told they could disembark in Chile for flights, but ultimately that was forbidden. Holland America deployed the Rotterdam to offer relief. Rotterdam met Zaandam off Panama on March 26 to ""provide extra supplies, staff, Covid-19 test kits and other support as needed."" Previously, the ship had no coronavirus test kits on board. Holland America transferred healthy Zaandam guests to Rotterdam, which is also is looking for a port. Wednesday afternoon, both vessels were off the western tip of Cuba, according to the ship tracking website MarineTraffic. The president of Holland America Line, Orlando Ashford, wrote an op-ed printed in the South Florida Sun Sentinel on Monday asking for compassion for the Zaandam's guests.  ""And we need confirmation from a port that is willing to extend the same compassion and grace that Panama did, and allow us to come in so our guests can go straight to the airport for flights home. It's tempting to speculate about the illnesses that may have been avoided or lives saved if we'd gotten the assistance we sought weeks ago,"" he wrote as the ship seeks a place to dock. "
Thousands of Tennessee doctors and local officials want the governor to issue stay-at-home order," (CNN)A growing chorus of Tennessee doctors and local leaders want Gov. Bill Lee to issue a stay-at-home order, warning that the coronavirus outbreak will only worsen in the state if he doesn't.CNN's Alicia Lee contributed to this report. At least 80% of the U.S. population is under a stay-at-home or shelter-in-place order, according to a CNN count. In Tennessee, Lee has resisted issuing a mandate, opting instead to issue an order that strongly urges residents to stay at home. ""I want again, to speak to the Tennesseans, who have the privilege and the capacity to safely stay home for the next two weeks. We need you to do that,"" Lee said at a press conference on Tuesday.  Signed Monday, the order closes non-essential businesses that were still open, like hair salons, spas, theaters, concert venues and other entertainment establishments. Churches are exempt from the state order which took effect overnight on Tuesday. Lee said Monday that he was not issuing a mandated shelter in place order because it is  ""deeply important to me"" to protect personal liberties. Dr. Aaron Milstone, a Franklin County-based acute care pulmonologist, is part of a group of doctors that have been critical of Lee's decision not to issue a mandate. ""Urging people is not a mandate,"" Milstone said. ""Unfortunately human psyche is unless you are told what to do, and there are some teeth in that telling, you won't do it."" Milstone likened the Covid-19 outbreak to a Category 5 hurricane where mandates are issued for the public's safety. ""Covid-19 is going to be larger than any Category 5 hurricane to hit,"" Milstone said. ""It is going to make Katrina look like a rain shower. (Governor Lee) needs to stop politicizing this pandemic."" Petition from doctors for stay-at-home order Milstone's group joined with the Tennessee Medical Association to organize an online petition that, as of Wednesday morning, had nearly 30,000 signatures of both doctors and residents in support of the governor issuing a stay-at-home order. Nearly every medical association and more than 100 mayors across the state have endorsed this cause as well, according to Milstone. Millstone and nine other medical leaders sent a letter to the governor last week urging him to ""act swiftly."" ""It is our estimation that we have little time to ""flatten the curve"" on the current situation,"" the letter reads. ""China and South Korea have made great progress by imposing restrictive measures. We ask that Tennessee do the same."" Milstone's letter was accompanied by a letter from the Middle Tennessee Mayors Caucus urging the governor to listen to the outcry from the medical community. ""We feel strongly that the quickest path to recovery is a uniform response to this challenge,"" the letter reads, adding that the mayors ""must also emphasize that our ability to manage the pandemic at the local level is limited and varied."" Milstone said he has been modeling what Tennessee may need on projections on the demand for hospital usage in each state by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington. Based on the institute's modeling, Milstone said the outbreak may peak in three weeks, Tennessee will be short 7,000 hospital beds and 1,700 ICU beds, and in need of 2,000 ventilators the state does not have.

Bernie Sanders calls on Wisconsin to delay primary over coronavirus concerns," (CNN)Sen. Bernie Sanders has called on Wisconsin to postpone its primary next Tuesday amid concerns that voters and poll workers could be exposed to coronavirus. According to CNN Health, the state has recorded more than 1,300 Covid-19 cases and seen nearly two dozen deaths. ""People should not be forced to put their lives on the line to vote, which is why 15 states are now following the advice of public health experts and delaying their elections,"" Sanders said in a statement on Wednesday. ""We urge Wisconsin to join them."" He also called on the state to extend early voting, once the election has been pushed back, and ""work to move entirely to vote-by-mail."" In the meantime, Sanders encouraged his supporters to cast their ballots through the mail. Sanders trails former Vice President Joe Biden in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination, which has been thrown into limbo by the coronavirus crisis. Neither candidate has been able to hold live rallies or ""get out the vote"" drives, but Biden has not called on Wisconsin to delay its election. In a statement Wednesday touting a new endorsement, the Biden campaign called on ""all voters to follow social distancing guidelines to slow the spread of COVID-19"" and linked to state-issued guidelines. Wisconsin is one of the few remaining states not to push back its primary in response to worries that in-person voting locations could become hot spots for the transmission of the virus. Democratic Gov. Tony Evers issued a stay-at-home order last week and, with poll workers increasingly dropping out, revealed in a court filing first reported by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that he plans to use the National Guard to help staff Election Day poll sites. The Guard will assist as poll workers, ""but it is anticipated that the assistance of the National Guard will not satisfy all of the current staffing needs,"" court documents say.   The brief, filed in a federal lawsuit, detailed other measures taken ahead of the election, including a push toward absentee ballots, which would ""mitigate many of the concerns about direct contact between groups of people at polling places,"" the brief said.   As of Wednesday morning, 1,053,556 absentee applications had been received by Wisconsin municipal clerks, according to a release from the Wisconsin Elections Commission. ""In comparison, there were 819,316 absentee ballots cast in the November 2016 Presidential Election,"" the release said.   Wisconsin has approximately 30,000 poll workers and a ""significant number of them are in their 60s and 70s, and many may have other health conditions,"" according to the elections commission. On March 23, two weeks before the election, the commission said it was in need of volunteers ""to replace older poll workers who are unable to serve due to health concerns and the coronavirus"" pandemic. ""We all stand ready to adjust as directed to ensure the safety of clerks, poll workers and voters,"" said Meagan Wolfe, Wisconsin's chief elections official. On Wednesday evening, Ben Wikler, the chairman of the Wisconsin Democratic Party, endorsed postponing the primary. ""The Democratic Party of Wisconsin endorses the call by civil rights groups & mayors across Wisconsin to postpone our April 7 election & remove barriers to safe voting by mail. We're in court NOW. If judge doesn't act, legislature must,"" Wikler said on Twitter. Other states with April primaries have postponed them or shifted those contests to vote-by-mail only. But Evers so far has stopped short of calling for similar measures. Republicans who control the state Legislature and have enacted strict voter-identification laws in recent years, meanwhile, are refusing Evers' request -- made last week, 11 days before the election -- to quickly enact a law that would send absentee ballots to every voter in the state. Wisconsin law gives the state's Department of Health Services the power to ""authorize and implement all emergency measures necessary to control communicable diseases"" and the authority to ""close schools and forbid public gatherings in schools, churches, and other places to control outbreaks and epidemics."" But any move to push back the election would likely be met with court challenges, and Evers has not yet shown any inclination to follow fellow Gov. Mike DeWine, an Ohio Republican, in bulling forward despite legal efforts to maintain the current date.   "
The problem with shutting down outpatient care,"Dr. Vance Vanier is an emergency medicine physician and clinical assistant professor at Stanford University Medical Center.

My colleague with a family history of melanoma needs that suspicious mole examined. My elderly friend who struggles with glaucoma and cataracts still needs to see her ophthalmologist.  All of these conditions require outpatient care -- a suddenly scarce resource in the setting of Covid-19.Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook The ongoing medical needs of hundreds of millions of American do not magically stop in this pandemic. Lawmakers urgently need to address the damaging impact that our current response to Covid-19 is having on our outpatient care infrastructure. Despite the $130 billion earmarked for hospital support in the $2 trillion coronavirus rescue package, large numbers of outpatient clinics are shutting down nationwide as they struggle to interpret contradictory, vaguely-worded government directives. On one hand, health care facilities are deemed ""essential"" businesses that should remain open in state lockdowns. On the other hand, directives such as Surgeon General Jerome Adams' on March 14 request that providers ""please consider stopping elective procedures until we can #FlattentheCurve."" A growing tide of outpatient clinics find it difficult to remain in business because of these conflicting guidelines. Is outpatient health care essential in this crisis, or is it elective? In a March 18 briefing, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services administrator Seema Verma said government guidelines canceling elective medicine ""will help surgeons, patients and hospitals prioritize what is essential, while leaving the ultimate decision in the hands of state and local health officials and those clinicians who have direct responsibility to their patients."" In essence, outpatient doctors should treat patients only for emergency procedures. However, there are numerous diseases where each day of delay can lead to an ever mounting public health crisis that will remain long after Covid-19 has been contained. Should mammograms, colonoscopies, diabetic wound checks, skin cancer exams and cataract surgeries really be put on indefinite hold when we consider the enormous societal burden of cancer, diabetes, heart conditions and ophthalmic disease in the elderly? Outpatient care facilities provide invaluable support within our health care system, which is why an extraordinary group of partners and I co-founded Chicago Pacific Founders, a strategic firm that invests exclusively in healthcare services, including outpatient clinics. At the end of 2019, the Bureau of Labor Statistics estimated there were more than 621,000 ambulatory care centers actively providing care in the United States. However, because true emergencies account for a tiny percentage of a clinic's daily business, outpatient facilities have seen a sharp decline in patient traffic in recent weeks. In Texas, the chief executive for Premier Family Physicians, a network of 42 Austin-based primary care providers, reported that patient visits had dropped by about 30% because of the coronavirus, even when accounting for an increase in virtual visits. These clinics cannot afford to stay open for potential emergencies. As Premier's CEO shared with The Texas Tribune, ""To take away 30, 40% of your volume, the margins in your primary care business will run out in a matter of weeks or months."" These economics explain why large numbers of outpatient facilities are in the process of shutting down.  Everyday health problems don't disappear in a pandemic. Within a short time, outpatient closures will lead to the further overcrowding of emergency departments with non-Covid-19 patients. This will make treating pandemic-affected patients more challenging and worsen the very capacity problem the government was attempting to solve by delaying elective procedures.  Administrators for the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) pressed this point when they decided to continue routine visits and some elective surgeries. In an internal policy document, obtained by Yahoo News, system administrators wrote that they would need to take an approach to elective care that could co-exist with Covid-19 priorities. ""Balancing the ongoing clinical needs of our patients with avoidance of unnecessary exposure requires a nuanced approach,"" they wrote, ""not an across-the-board cancelling of clinics and procedures."" Yet, facilities like UPMC seem to be in the minority. Fear has swept the outpatient world, spurred on by inadvisably broad policies that call for mass cancellations of elective medicine. Physicians fear being held liable for not conforming to government guidelines, and nervous patients are unfairly called upon to make medical judgments about the urgency of their care. The anxiety created by these policies prompts patients and providers alike to cancel appointments, often without a conversation about what falls within the vague definition of elective medicine.  This pervasive fear exists despite the fact that outpatient clinics that have proactive policies of social distancing -- such as asking patients to wait in their cars, rather than in the waiting room -- can make them far safer for people than grocery stores and capable of providing care in a safe, effective manner. Furthermore, well-intentioned ideas to repurpose outpatient health care providers to inpatient Covid-19 care or save supplies for hospitals do not address the ongoing fundamental needs of tens of millions of Americans with chronic diseases. We need to move toward a new solution, and quickly. As an emergency medicine physician, I fully recognize and have experienced the severity of the Covid-19 crisis. But the government must take a more nuanced stance on its policies for elective medicine. Rather than effectively shutting down non-hospital clinics, our leaders should trust in doctors' medical judgment and precautionary measures so that clinics can remain open, and all patients can get the care that they deserve during this crisis. Stricter guidelines that outline or mandate outpatient clinic social distancing protocols, such as those in waiting rooms, would be a more effective way to address concerns around physician and patient safety. Let's get our outpatient doctors and nurses back to work and caring for the patients who need them now more than ever. "
Trump confronts reality: You can't spin a germ," (CNN)In an odd way, it's President Donald Trump who seems the most taken aback by recent developments in the coronavirus crisis. How confusing it must be for a spinmeister who has been able to say that everything from the Mueller and Ukraine investigations were a hoax to now confront a virus, an untamed germ that he couldn't or wouldn't see coming. He can't intimidate a virus, demean it with a dismissing epithet or bully it.  Somehow his ""I alone can fix it"" refrain in his convention acceptance speech seems more hollow than ever. And sadly, his description of ""American carnage"" in his inaugural speech now takes on a grim new meaning.  History shows that in a crisis, citizens generally rally around their president. So it was for Bush 43 after the September 11 attacks. And for Bush 41 during the Gulf War. And President Trump calls himself a wartime president as his approval ratings inch up. Of course, the President's new resolve is evident now for all to see. How could it be otherwise? April may be the cruelest month as scientists tell the American people to be ready for an awful spring of sickness rather than renewal. They see graphs charting death curves beyond anyone's previous imaginings. They are being told that wearing masks outside might be a good idea. And they're not working. Just worrying. Trump is now telling us he rejected a ""group"" of people who told him the virus was like a flu, nothing more. Except he didn't; he led the chorus. (And who was that group anyway? Didn't he know more?) By now, his past refrains are familiar. ""This is a flu,"" he told us on February 26. ""This is like a flu."" It would disappear, ""like a miracle"" with the warmer weather. Or, it's ""totally under control,"" and will get down to zero cases. Or, let's go back to work by Easter. ""Wouldn't it be great?"" The vice president told Wolf Blitzer the President is just simply ""optimistic."" Seriously. The man who had scientific expertise at his fingertips -- all pointing in an opposite direction -- just insisted on lying. Never mind that all citizens want in a crisis is the truth. Trump said he soft-pedaled the threat because ""you know, I'm the cheerleader for the country."" And in doing that, many Americans believed -- or wanted to believe -- their president. After all, he had to know more than the rest of us, right? And the virus continued to spread unabated in January and February and March -- and hasn't stopped yet. But Trump was playing the same game he has always played. Back in the early '90s, when authorities shut down a third of his slot machines in Atlantic City on the opening night of his new casino, he later told Larry King they melted down from overuse. He couldn't face the truth, much less admit it publicly. Now Trump has no choice. The truth is in the science. And every American -- and the world -- is watching to see if he can finally tell it. "
Federal appeals court won't lift block on Florida law making it harder for ex-felons to vote,"Washington (CNN)A federal appeals court in Florida has declined to review a decision it made in February blocking a state law requiring former felons to pay back all legal financial obligations before they vote.CNN's Kelly Mena and Pamela Kirkland contributed to this report. The court's decision Tuesday, a setback for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, is the latest development in a series of legal challenges concerning the Republican-led effort to first make ex-felons pay court-ordered fines and fees in order to exercise their right to vote, which was given to them in a 2018 amendment. In February, a three-judge panel of the 11th US Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a preliminary injunction from a district court that allowed 17 former felons the ability to have their voting rights restored, even with unpaid fines, fees, and restitution. The case, set to go to trial in district court in April, could apply to the estimated 1.4 million former felons in the Sunshine State who had their voting rights restored. On Tuesday, the 11th Circuit denied DeSantis and Secretary of State Laurel Lee's request for an ""en banc"" review, meaning by the full bench, of its February decision. Tuesday's ruling said that no judge on the court requested a rehearing. The court also denied a rehearing by the three-judge panel. ""We are disappointed in the denial of a rehearing before the full court; none the less, the case is going to full trial in three weeks,"" the governor's communications office said in a statement provided to CNN. CNN has also reached out to Lee's office. In November 2018, nearly 65% of Florida voters approved Amendment 4, restoring the right to vote for convicted felons after they complete ""all terms of sentence,"" including parole or probation, except those convicted of murder or a felony sexual offense. After Amendment 4 went into effect in January 2019, the GOP-led Florida legislature passed and DeSantis signed a controversial law that clarified terms of sentence to include legal financial obligations such as fines, fees, and restitution.  A number of groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union, filed a flurry of legal challenges on the behalf of the 17 plaintiffs, arguing that the law discriminated based on wealth and was thus unconstitutional. They argued that the law again disenfranchised Floridians who had their rights restored with Amendment 4.  In October, US District Court Judge Robert Hinkle granted a preliminary injunction, allowing the plaintiffs to register to vote regardless of fines and fees associated with their convictions. He rejected a motion from DeSantis and Lee's lawyers to dismiss the case. ""Each of these plaintiffs have a constitutional right to vote so long as the state's only reason for denying the vote is failure to pay an amount the plaintiff is genuinely unable to pay,"" Hinkle wrote. DeSantis and Lee appealed to the 11th Circuit, which affirmed Hinkle's decision in February and said that the law violates the Constitution's Equal Protection Clause.  In a report submitted in court, University of Florida professor Daniel Smith concluded that over 774,000 people, or about 77% of those with felony convictions, across the state's 67 counties cannot register to vote because of outstanding financial obligations. ""The three-judge panel unanimously ruled that a person's right to vote cannot be contingent on their ability to pay, and the full Eleventh Circuit unanimously declined to reconsider the panel's decision,"" Daniel Tilley, legal director for the American Civil Liberties Union of Florida, said in a statement Tuesday. ""It is time for the state to give up on its quest to dismantle Amendment 4."" A trial in the US District Court for the Northern District of Florida is scheduled to begin on April 27 after previously being delayed due to coronavirus concerns. "
Pelosi: Trump and McConnell 'should not try to hide behind' impeachment excuse over coronavirus response,"Washington (CNN)House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Wednesday that President Donald Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ""should not try to hide behind an excuse"" in response to the suggestion from both the President and the Kentucky Republican that impeachment distracted the US government from the growing coronavirus crisis.  ""I think that's an admission that perhaps the President and the majority leader cannot handle the job,"" Pelosi told CNN's Anderson Cooper in an interview. ""We have a life and death situation in our country and they should not try to hide behind an excuse for why they did not take action, but it does admit that they did not take action,"" Pelosi said, adding, ""Right now we have to work together to get the job done."" In an interview on Tuesday with radio host Hugh Hewitt, McConnell said that the crisis ""came up while we were tied down in the impeachment trial. And I think it diverted the attention of the government, because everything, every day was all about impeachment."" During a press briefing on Tuesday, Trump echoed that argument, saying that impeachment ""probably did"" distract him from responding to the coronavirus outbreak. ""I think I handled it very well, but I guess it probably did (distract me),"" Trump said. ""I mean, I got impeached. I think, you know, I certainly devoted a little time to thinking about it."" He added, ""Did it divert my attention? I think I'm getting A+'s for the way I handled myself during a phony impeachment, OK? ... But certainly, I guess, I thought of it and I think I probably acted -- I don't think I would have done any better had I not been impeached, OK?"" Pelosi on 'phase four' coronavirus response: 'We have to be ready' House Democrats are already outlining what they would like to see in a ""phase four"" coronavirus legislative response, but McConnell said on Tuesday ""we'll have to wait and see"" when asked about the possibility of the next legislative steps.  Pelosi said on Wednesday that Congress will have to wait to enact new legislation given that members are now back in their home districts and states as the pandemic continues to rage, but argued that lawmakers should be ready to go when they return.  ""The fact is that we will be waiting because we are out of session because of shelter in place and other realities of life, but that doesn't mean that we can't be ready,"" she said.  ""We know already that we'll need more for state and local government. We know already that we'll need more for the National Institutes of Health. We also know that there were items that we could not get in the first three bills,"" she said. ""We need to do much more as well as invest in the recovery.""  ""It is going to be a number of weeks because we're not here, so rather than putting it off further, why aren't we working together? That's the way I like to do it, just have the four corners -- House and Senate, Democrats and Republicans -- putting together the bill again with the President's folks at the table to see what he would be willing to sign, so that we're not losing time,"" she said. ""We have to be ready, we have to be ready,"" she added.  Pelosi also said in her interview that she would like to see every state implement stay-at-home-orders.  ""It works. It works, and that's why the governors are doing it and they're seeing a return on that initiative,"" Pelosi said. ""That is the only way we're going to contain the virus.""  ""I would prayerfully hope that to avoid death, illness in families that they would do that. Yes, I'd like to see that,"" she said.  This story has been updated with additional developments Wednesday. "
Trump says he's a cheerleader for USA. We need a quarterback,"John Avlon is a senior political analyst at CNN. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN. (CNN)""I'm a cheerleader for the country,"" President Donald Trump said in his final coronavirus press conference in March — a month in which the US death toll increased from two to more than 4,000. Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook It was a rare moment of honesty in a press conference typically full of falsehoods. Trump has always been a cheerleader — a hype man, a master marketer of himself which he parlayed into hyperpartisan politics and the presidency. But, with apologies to cheerleaders, Trump is confronting a crisis he can't hype his way out of. He is standing on the sidelines, out of his depth and now we're all paying the price. What we need in the presidency right now is a quarterback — someone who calmly calls strategic plays under intense pressure. Instead, we have Donald Trump. And his instincts are perfectly wrong for a pandemic. Pandemics don't care about partisan politics. But Trump definitely does. And so we've seen a politicized and often petty response to the crisis from the President, despite having some of the best scientific experts, Dr. Anthony Fauci and Dr. Debbie Birx, on his team. We've seen the President diss Democratic governors in the hardest-hit states — from New York to Washington to Michigan, saying ""when they disrespect me, they're disrespecting our government.""  Someone should remind him that to get respect you've got to give respect. But now we may be seeing that reflexive partisanship trickling down to the delivery of critical medical supplies at a time when body bags are building up around our hospitals. President Trump's adopted home of Florida — a critical swing state in the upcoming election with a Republican governor — has somehow speedily received 100% of its requested medical supplies like 430,000 surgical masks and 180,000 N95 respirators. That's great for Florida, which is scrambling amid rising cases after resisting social distancing efforts.  But somehow Massachusetts has only received 17% of what it requested — according to an analysis by the Washington Post — while Illinois Gov. J. B. Pritzker told CNN's Chris Cuomo that his state has only received 10% of what it requested, which could cause serious shortages as soon as next week. This is all coming as the administration is warning to expect deaths to rise sharply in the coming weeks, with President Trump even trying to spin fatalities under 100,000 as evidence they had done  ""a very good job."" Seriously.  We're going to have to come up with a better phrase than moving the ""goal posts,"" as the Washington Post called it, to cover such a ghoulish shift in position from a president who just weeks ago was assuring American's the coronavirus was totally ""under control"" and would ""miraculously"" disappear in April.  Well, it's now April — and America has more cases of coronavirus than anywhere in the world. This is surely not what he meant by America first. There is a grim, growing awareness — even acknowledged by the President — that things are going to get much, much worse in the coming weeks. Still, we've heard the President persist with his lies about readily available coronavirus tests against all evidence. He's repeatedly attacked the media for asking tough but totally fair questions about his handling of the crisis and bragged about his ratings. This isn't reality TV anymore, Mr. President: ratings don't matter; results do.  Lately he's taken to saying that no one knew that coronavirus would be so contagious. Everybody knew except, apparently, the President. But Trump's talking points filtered down through partisan media and became a deadly form of misinformation, leading to a stark partisan gap on how seriously people were taking coronavirus in mid-March. It wasn't that long ago that we heard absurd attempts to rationalize the projected death toll from folks like Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson who told his home state paper, the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel, that ""getting coronavirus is not a death sentence except for maybe no more than 3.4% of our population (and) I think probably far less"" and added, ""we don't shut down our economy because tens of thousands of people die on the highways."" For the record, 3.4% of the current US population is 11.2 million. That's almost twice the population of Wisconsin. Luckily, it does appear that the fatality rate for coronavirus is far less than 3.4% — but that doesn't mean we should dismiss the deaths that are coming as acceptable collateral damage.  The understandable impulse to protect the economy from total free fall has led the Trump administration to embrace multitrillion-dollar bailouts and stimulus of the kind that many on the right attacked during the Bush and Obama response to the financial crisis. According to an administration official cited by the Wall Street Journal, Trump wants to further politicize the bailout by putting his name on all the checks that will be sent out. But political self-interest seems to have trumped any alleged fiscal conservative principles in the Republican Party long ago. Deficits and debt won't be discussed until there is a Democratic president. But they can't completely quit their impulse to own the libs by blaming the Obama administration for their testing and medical equipment fiascos while refusing to open Obamacare insurance exchanges for the rocketing number of new unemployed folks, according to new CNN reporting. We know that the Trump Justice Department is backing a lawsuit to destroy what's left of Obamacare (even though they'd rather wait for a final judgment until after the election). Give the current crisis, blocking people from getting access to open enrollment health care exchanges is petty and cruel. But with the gravity of the crisis taking hold inside Trumpland, it's the political impact of the pandemic that seems to be grabbing attention. According to the Los Angeles Times, ""One former White House official said Trump's reelection campaign advisers are terrified that the coronavirus outbreak, which so far has hit largely Democratic coastal cities hardest, will soon scythe across the rural areas that remain deeply loyal to Trump."" This is what happens to your brain on hyperpartisanship: Even pandemics are seen through a red state vs. blue state prism. It's a different kind of sickness that we don't have a cure for yet. But that doesn't mean we should think it's normal. It's not. Hype and hate won't stop this virus. Denial didn't work when President Trump tried it. And attacking Democratic governors won't help the country heal either. The coronavirus crisis reveals how stupid and self-defeating, hyperpartisan politics is when it comes to actually governing. If ever there was a time for nonideological problem solving and empathetic leadership, this is it.

Car sales are plunging in the US because of coronavirus,"New York (CNN Business)US car sales fell sharply in March, the latest blow to the nation's economy from the coronavirus outbreak. Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) announced Wednesday that its first-quarter sales in the United States fell by 10% even though sales were up the first two months of the quarter. ""Strong momentum in January and February was more than offset by the negative economic impact of the coronavirus in March,"" said the company. General Motors (GM) reported a 7% drop in sales for the quarter, which it attributed to the sharp decline in March sales because of the virus outbreak.  Neither company would release the month-by-month sales figures. But Toyota (TM) reported results for both March and the quarter. Its daily sales pace plunged 32% in March, while its overall sales in the month fell 37%, hurt in addition by one fewer sales day in the month. Overall, its first-quarter sales fell 9%, similar to the declines reported at Ford and GM. So it's possible that Ford and GM suffered a similar decline in March to what Toyota reported. Many other automakers are due to report March or first-quarter sales Wednesday or Thursday. But none are likely to report good sales said Michelle Krebs, senior analyst for Cox Automotive. ""What did save them is that March started out pretty well, but then it fell off a cliff,"" said Krebs. Numerous factors are working against car sales. Top among those factors is that more than three-quarters of Americans live in states or cities where they are being told to stay at home except for essentials such as shopping for food, drugs or seeking medical care. In addition, many potential buyers are suffering economic setbacks because of the businesses they work for or own being closed. More than 3 million people recently filed for unemployment benefits, a record for one week. And that has frozen a lot of potential buyers out of the credit market because of their job or economic situation, Krebs said. ""The three things that most determine car sales are credit, employment and consumer confidence,"" she said. ""All are working against car sales. April is going to be even worse."" Fiat Chrysler responded with the most aggressive sales incentives yet on the market. The offer, rolled out Wednesday, allows eligible buyers to get a seven-year interest-free loan with payments deferred for 90 days. But buyers still need to qualify for the loan. The company said it is now offering a new online purchase option that allows buyers to purchase a vehicle off a dealer lot, conduct a vehicle trade-in process, apply for credit, receive price and payment estimates and review service protection plan options.  Most dealerships remain open, according to Fiat-Chrysler, but there are some states where dealerships have been ordered to close, Krebs said. About 37% people surveyed by Cox Automotive say they will wait going to a dealership, even for servicing on their car, because of health concerns. So the drop in car sales will probably continue, no matter the incentives that are offered, said Krebs. In addition to the economic headwinds, millions of additional workers who are still on the job are working from home, reducing their need for a car to commute to work or get children to school or other activities that have also been canceled. Another factor working against car sales is the recent stock market turmoil that hurt many people's savings, which can also reduce the willingness of people to purchase a big-ticket item like a new car. But if sales have ground to a near halt, so has the supply of vehicles for dealerships.  Virtually all automakers have halted production of new cars and trucks, as 97% of auto plants in North America and Europe have shut operations, according to research firm GlobalData. Automakers such as Ford (F), which stated plans to restart production in April, now say they have no definitive date for when they will be able to build cars again. "
This is no April Fool's. British American Tobacco is trying to make a coronavirus vaccine,"London (CNN Business)The maker of Camel, Lucky Strike and Pall Mall cigarettes is trying its hand at a new product: a coronavirus vaccine.  British American Tobacco (BTAFF) said Wednesday that its biotech subsidiary, Kentucky BioProcessing, is working on a potential vaccine for the novel coronavirus that can be produced in lab-grown plants closely related to tobacco.  The biotech firm, which helped develop an experimental Ebola treatment in 2014, joins dozens of other companies racing to develop a vaccine for Covid-19, which has now infected over 880,000 people globally and claimed more than 44,000 lives.  The development of vaccines typically takes years, but scientists and government authorities are hoping to fast-track the process to prevent a resurgence of the virus. Many experts say a vaccine is at least 18 months away, but others caution that even that timetable is optimistic. British American Tobacco said that its potential vaccine is currently being tested on animals, and it is ""exploring partnerships with government agencies"" to bring the vaccine to clinical studies. ""Vaccine development is challenging and complex work, but we believe we have made a significant break-through with our tobacco plant technology platform,"" said David O'Reilly, director of scientific research at British American Tobacco.  If clinical trials go ahead, the company said it hopes to produce up to 3 million doses of the vaccine per week beginning in June. Those doses will go to waste if the trials aren't successful, but it's ""a price worth paying"" to save time, O'Reilly said. In order to produce the potential vaccine, Kentucky BioProcessing cloned a portion of the novel coronavirus' genetic sequence and injected that into the plants, which developed a potential antigen — a substance that induces an immune response in the body and is needed to fight viruses. That is now being tested on rodents. According to the World Health Organization, plant-derived vaccines can be produced cheaply in very high amounts and are less likely than traditionally developed vaccines to contain contaminants that are harmful. Efforts by a cigarette maker to address an urgent public health issue could raise eyebrows, however. ""I would hope the politics of tobacco wouldn't interfere here and that people will determine objectively whether our technology could be helpful or not,"" O'Reilly told CNN Business. Kentucky BioProcessing was involved in the production of ZMapp in 2014, a treatment that was tested with some success on Ebola patients in the United States before it was abandoned in favor of more effective alternatives.

"A man was showing symptoms of coronavirus, but came to the hospital to see his partner give birth"," (CNN)A woman who gave birth in a New York hospital was discharged after she started showing symptoms of coronavirus.  Staff at Rochester's Strong Memorial Hospital later learned that her partner, who was present for her delivery, may have been exposed to the virus.  The couple and their baby were discharged from the hospital and asked to quarantine themselves, University of Rochester Medical Center spokesperson Barbara Ficarra told CNN.  Ficarra wouldn't confirm to CNN whether the woman's partner had known about his possible exposure before visiting her.  But another University of Rochester Medicine spokesperson told local paper the Democrat & Chronicle that he did, and that he told hospital staff he was healthy before visiting.  ""The mother became symptomatic shortly after delivering,"" spokesman Chip Partner told the paper. ""That's when the significant other admitted his potential exposure and that he was feeling symptomatic."" Neither Ficarra nor Partner confirmed whether the couple or their child had tested positive for coronavirus.  None of the obstetric staff involved in the unnamed woman's delivery have tested positive for coronavirus, Ficarra said. One staff member who showed symptoms quarantined themselves and later tested negative.  While their results were pending, though, hospital staff who came into contact with the couple and weren't symptomatic were required to continue to work while wearing masks and to submit to temperature checks twice a day, she said.  The couple spent their hospital stint in a private maternity ward, isolated from other patients, she said, so it's unlikely other patients were potentially exposed.  The hospital enacted a strict visitor policy  It's critical everywhere to curb coronavirus from spreading within hospitals, but it's especially dire in New York: The state is reporting the bulk of coronavirus cases in the US at over 80,000, according to CNN's tally.  As a result, University of Rochester Medicine Hospitals have restricted all visitors with few exceptions. One ""support person"" is permitted to be in the room for patients in labor, though they must be screened for symptoms twice daily. And once that support person is in the patient's room, they cannot leave.  Theirs isn't the most restrictive visitor policy tried in the state. The NewYork-Presbyterian healthcare system initially banned all visitors, including the partners of patients giving birth. Hospital officials said the extreme measure was enacted after patients who were asymptomatic later tested positive.  But New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo later issued an executive order to allow obstetric patients to have one visitor.  ""In no hospital in New York will a woman be forced to be alone when she gives birth,"" Cuomo tweeted. ""Not now, not ever.""  States get strict on stay-at-home orders Unknowingly spreading coronavirus is not a crime. But several states are toughening up on social distancing, and now, violating stay-at-home orders is an arrestable offense.  In Hawaii, all visitors or residents who travel between islands must quarantine themselves for 14 days. Anyone who violates that order could face a fine of up to $5,000 or a one-year prison sentence, if convicted.  In Florida, a megachurch pastor was arrested and charged with unlawful assembly and a violation of health emergency rules for holding services for hundreds of churchgoers. A Louisiana pastor who held services and said the virus was a political ploy was hit with similar charges. Police have broken up weddings and house parties in New Jersey and charged hosts with disorderly conduct.  "
GLAAD criticizes FDA ban on blood and plasma donations from gay and bisexual men during coronavirus pandemic," (CNN)Federal guidelines preventing men who have sex with other men from donating blood for clinical trials to treat coronavirus patients are discriminatory, LGBTQ advocacy group GLAAD said.CNN's Kara Scannell and Brynn Gingras contributed to this report. A petition, nearing 20,000 signatures, calls for an end to the ""antiquated ban"" for donating blood, the media advocacy organization for people who identify as gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender and/or queer said.  The blood donation policy according to the FDA's guidelines, is an attempt to reduce the risk of HIV transmission.  ""The FDA cannot let an outdated and discriminatory ban on blood donations from gay and bi men get in the way of potentially life-saving treatment for the country's painful current health crisis,"" said GLAAD President and CEO Sarah Kate Ellis. ""Continuing to enforce this antiquated policy is dangerous, irresponsible, and flies in the face of recommendations from medical experts."" An FDA spokesperson, acknowledging the decline in blood and plasma donations across the US, told CNN, ""At this time, FDA's recommendations regarding blood donor deferral for men who have sex with men have not changed, but we are actively considering the situation as the outbreak progresses."" The FDA said last week that it was expediting blood plasma treatment for those seriously ill with coronavirus, and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said that the state is pursuing trials of the treatment as well.  The process, known as plasma-derived therapy or ""convalescent plasma,"" involves doctors testing the plasma of people who recovered for antibodies to the virus and then injecting that plasma, or a derivative of it, into the sick person. ""There are so many gay men in [New York] who have clean blood that we are ready to give,"" a 28-year-old man told CNN. The man said he tested positive for coronavirus on March 16 and has since recovered. Friends sent him links to calls for plasma donations to help save the lives of others; and though he wanted to take part, he soon came across the GLAAD announcement informing him that was not possible. He was furious. ""To know that I have blood right now inside my body that could potentially save the life or help someone else who has Covid-19,"" he said, ""I can't see it being anything other than homophobic beliefs."" The FDA began barring blood donations from men who have sex with men in 1985. A 2015 update of the policy made men who had not had sex with a man in at least 12 months eligible to donate blood. Only people who are eligible to donate blood are eligible to donate plasma, the FDA said in a news release. In the FDA's policy guidelines, the agency says that, ""Sex with an HIV-positive partner was associated with a 132-fold increase in risk for being HIV-positive, and a history of male-to-male sexual contact was associated with a 62-fold increase in risk."" ""If it really was about HIV, there would be a questionnaire about how much sex people have had,"" the man said. A group of senators, including Chris Coons, Amy Klobuchar, Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris and Tammy Duckworth, signed a letter to the FDA on March 26 calling on the blood donation policy to be overturned because coronavirus is increasing a nationwide shortage of donated blood needed to save lives, according to the letter. ""We must take every possible step to secure our nation's blood supply in this critical time, and in order to do so, we need to shift away from antiquated and stigmatizing donation policies to ones that are scientifically sound, based on individual risk, and inclusive of all potential healthy blood donors,"" the letter said. "
A Facebook group matches RVs that are sitting idle with health care workers who need a place to isolate after long hospital shifts," (CNN)For Mark Quale, an emergency room physician in Burlington, North Carolina, coming home after a long day at the hospital was as stressful as work itself. With two young boys, a wife and elderly mother-in-law at home, he knew that if he wasn't cautious, he could spread the novel coronavirus to his own family.   So just as he arrived home from work, he would strip off his scrubs on the front porch, walk the specific route to his bathroom that was cordoned off by a tarp and wash all the germs off in the shower.  But today, Quale's mind is more at peace because he's able to isolate himself in a 31-foot travel trailer, and it's all thanks to a Facebook group called RVs 4 MDs, which matches health care workers to local RV owners. It started with a Facebook post From an ICU nurse in Twin Cities, Minnesota, to an ER doctor in Lynchburg, Virginia, RVs 4 MDs has matched dozens of health care workers with RVs, trailers and campers in their area. The Facebook group has already racked up nearly 3,000 members, an incredible number given the fact that the group was created just one week ago.  Last Monday, Emily Phillips, a mother of three from Celina, Texas, had posted on her Facebook asking if anybody had an RV her family could borrow as her husband was an ER doctor in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. A woman named Holly Haggard replied saying that Phillips could borrow hers.  ""Before the RV, I was a nervous wreck. Every time my husband walked in the door or put his hand on something, I thought we were going to get (Covid-19), including my baby,"" Phillips said. ""But now that he's in that RV, I'm back to my life, focused on my full-time job and my kids, and it's completely changed our situation.""  Knowing that there were countless other families in similar situations as hers, Phillips took on Haggard as her business partner and the two created RVs 4 MDs, which went live last Tuesday night.  In a matter of one week, the two Texan moms have built the simple Facebook group into a robust volunteer organization, complete with a board of directors and network of volunteers spanning across the nation.   Kindness from complete strangers Quale and his family were one of the first to be matched with an RV from a pair of kind strangers named Kelsey and Tim Webb. The two families had never met before, but Tim drove his trailer for 2.5 hours to Quale's home, gave Quale's wife, LaRayne, the keys and told her that they could use it for as long as they needed.  ""It was such an emotional thing to go through and to have someone offer up their RV completely for free, I felt so blessed,"" LaRayne, who now volunteers with RVs 4 MDs said. ""I asked if they wanted us to cover the insurance, but they wanted nothing... They said that they are praying for us and rooting for us.""  Kelsey, who normally makes money by renting out the trailer, said donating it to the Quales was a ""no-brainer.""  ""This family was in need and this was the one way we could help,"" Kelsey told CNN. ""You can't put a price tag on this... It just makes my heart happy that we're able to do this for them and give them peace of mind.""  Quale said he was extremely proud of his fellow health care workers on the front lines of this pandemic, but he added that this virus isn't something that can be defeated by the medical professionals alone.  ""(RVs 4 MDs) demonstrates that there is so much more to fighting the coronavirus than what happens at the hospital. There are layers upon layers of people fighting this in different ways. The reason I'm able to fight this right now is because of my wife and the work that these people are doing so we can focus on the medical portion and not have to worry about the rest,"" Quale said.  More volunteers are needed Every hour, there are new posts on the Facebook page from spouses and family members looking to be matched with an RV.  ""Looking for an RV in Grapevine Texas. Wife is camping out on the apt patio,"" one post reads. ""ER Doc in Rochester NY has been living in the garage for 3 weeks to protect our 3 kids and me,"" another post reads.  But with each new request, there's an equal amount of posts from RV owners saying that they want to help.  ""I have never seen anything like this in my entire life,"" Phillips said. ""The amount of people that are stepping up to help with a project where they aren't even getting a dime in return is unbelievable.""   To keep up with this project that has spread like wildfire, Phillips has recruited the help of attorneys, people in insurance and IT, but what she needs the most right now are more volunteers, she said.  ""We need more volunteers to head up the different states,"" Phillips said. ""A lot of people are out there with nothing to do. Well, we got something to do and it can really help a lot.""  Phillips and her team hope to expand the program into Canada, set up an official website, and even keep it going after the coronavirus crisis is over.  ""We're going to keep it running until there's not one person left on the planet that needs an RV or needs shelter,"" Phillips said. ""Whether it's a storm or whatever the case is, we'll have this organization for the next crisis because there's always going to be a need for shelter.""  "
What Trump can do now to rescue America's factories and farms,"Mary E. Lovely is a professor of economics at Syracuse University and non-resident senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. The opinions expressed in this commentary are her own. As federal, state and local officials race to contain the spread of Covid-19, intense efforts have begun to address the mounting economic damage of the virus. President Trump and the US Congress have passed a $2 trillion fiscal stimulus package to funnel immediate help to American families while minimizing closures and layoffs. But Washington should not overlook one other simple and effective tool: suspending the remaining tariffs on Chinese imports.  Although President Trump signed a ""phase one"" agreement with China in January, high tariffs remain on an original $350 billion in US imports. Getting rid of these tariffs will remove a painful yoke that had depressed American manufacturing and farming long before the coronavirus hit our shores. What's more, tariff rollbacks signal a desire to reduce mounting US-China trade tensions, offering a much-needed model of global cooperation at a time of shared crisis. Trump's trade war with China never made sense for America's factories. US tariffs on Chinese imports currently average about 20% and continue to cover two-thirds of US purchases. These taxes fall heaviest on parts and components used by US manufacturers. Firms facing Trump's tariffs are central to American manufacturing — they account for 84% of all exports and 65% of manufacturing employment. As these businesses experience unprecedented disruption from the coronavirus, they face significant financial and operational consequences, with no end in sight. A recent analysis of the 2018-19 tariff hikes suggests that import tax relief would be a meaningful way to assist American factories: Estimated tariffs paid by affected manufacturers were about $1,600 per worker per year. With tariff relief, these funds could be directed to assisting workers and meeting new health and hygiene needs. Suspending tariffs would put the onus on China to remove retaliatory tariffs on American agricultural exports, a move it would be likely to take. Throughout the trade war, China responded proportionally to each US action, meeting each tariff increase and rollback in kind. Given this pattern, China can be expected to cut its own tariffs in response to American actions to keep trade flowing during the crisis. Trump's trade war has put US farms at risk since its inception in 2018. Farm bankruptcies have risen, despite the distribution of emergency aid to farmers, and the administration has found it difficult to locate alternative markets for American grains and meats. As the economic impact of the coronavirus reduces consumption in major American agricultural markets around the globe, farmers are at heightened risk of further losses. The American Farm Bureau Federation states that ""COVID-19 impact on agriculture includes a rapid and unanticipated decline in commodity prices."" With the Chinese economy already beginning to recover from the virus, reopening their market to US exports will help to counteract these price declines and help American farmers avoid further unnecessary bankruptcies. President Trump can suspend his China tariffs immediately. He levied the tariffs through his executive powers, and he can simply suspend them as he suspended tariffs that had been teed up for implementation in December 2019. China already promised in the ""phase one"" agreement to purchase hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of US goods, and suspending tariffs would help ensure that they meet those targets. Moreover, the president can restore tariffs at any time, at any level, if they are deemed necessary. How America treats its trading partners now will resonate for years to come. Already, protectionism, not cooperation, is the order of the day. Global Trade Alert reports that, to date, 24 nations have placed limits on the export of medicine, medical equipment and supplies, a clear sign that international coordination is dangerously lacking at a time when we desperately need it. By dropping its harmful China tariffs, the United States can regain leadership of a system that is rudderless in a time of shared crisis. With Americans facing the unprecedented challenges of Covid-19 containment, and the deep recession that is expected to follow, it is time for President Trump to end a harmful policy that has outlived any usefulness. Suspending US tariffs on Chinese imports is a simple, immediate step that will quickly ease pain at home and demonstrate American leadership to a world sadly in need. "
What does it mean to be furloughed?," (CNN)Companies are furloughing thousands of workers due to the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. How small business owners may benefit from the $2 trillion federal aid packageMany of us are now WFH. Here's how to ask for the schedule you needThese Americans say $1,200 isn't enough. But it's better than nothing Macy's, Gap (GPS) and Kohl's (KSS) announced Monday they are furloughing workers, while hotel chain Marriott (MAR) also recently announced that tens of thousands of workers are facing a similar fate.  But what exactly does it mean to be furloughed and how does it differ from being laid off?  Layoff vs. furlough A layoff is a separation of employment that can be either temporary or permanent. This means the worker is not kept on the company's payroll, but could be rehired at a later date.  A furloughed worker is still considered an employee, but they have been forced to take a break from work without pay or to reduce their hours.  Furloughs tend to last less than six months since any period longer than that could trigger employment laws that mandate companies to provide the type of advance notification that can be required ahead of mass layoffs, according to Laura O'Donnell, partner at law firm Haynes and Boone.  Furloughed workers also usually get to keep their seniority status and return to the same pay level when they are brought back. Generally, furloughed workers' retirement benefits stay in place for as long as they are on the payroll, but the status of their health coverage can depend on the company's plans. Many require employees to work a certain number of hours to be eligible for coverage, but some insurance companies are loosening their requirements for furloughed workers due to the outbreak, O'Donnell said.  Kohl's, for example, said it will continue to provide existing health benefits to its furloughed associates, and Macy's (M) said furloughed workers who are enrolled in its health plan will receive coverage, with the company covering 100% of the premium through at least May.  Why do a furlough?  Furloughing workers is a cost-saving move that can help a company weather a rough patch.  The decision is usually temporary with the hope that workers will eventually be brought back once economic conditions improve.  It can also be good for morale.  ""If they are expecting it to be much more temporary and short term, it is easier to bring folks back than it is to go through the rehire process,"" said Michael Schmidt, vice chair of the labor and employment department at the law firm Cozen O'Connor.  What furloughed workers should know   While state laws vary, furloughed workers can usually apply for unemployment benefits, according to Schmidt.   Furloughed employees are not supposed to work during their time off and, unless you are contractually obligated to a company, you can still look for another job while being furloughed.  Also, employers cannot discriminate when it comes to who gets furloughed.  ""Companies want to make sure they are not discriminating or retaliating in their employment decisions, including who is getting furloughed and who is not,"" warned Schmidt. ""If it's not the entire workforce, make sure there is legitimate business interest in making the selection."" "
FDA calls for heartburn drug Zantac to be pulled from market immediately," (CNN)The US Food and Drug Administration is requesting that manufacturers pull all prescription and over-the-counter ranitidine drugs, known by the brand name Zantac, from the market immediately, the agency announced on Wednesday.Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team. The FDA noted that an ongoing investigation has determined that levels of a contaminant in the heartburn medications increase over time and when stored at higher-than-normal temperatures, pose a risk to public health.  The contaminant, N-nitrosodimethylamine or NDMA, is a probable human carcinogen and the FDA has been investigating levels of it in ranitidine since the summer of 2019. ""We didn't observe unacceptable levels of NDMA in many of the samples that we tested,"" Dr. Janet Woodcock, director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said in Wednesday's announcement. ""However, since we don't know how or for how long the product might have been stored, we decided that it should not be available to consumers and patients unless its quality can be assured,"" Woodcock said in part. ""The FDA will continue our efforts to ensure impurities in other drugs do not exceed acceptable limits so that patients can continue taking medicines without concern."" According to the FDA's announcement, letters are now being sent to all manufacturers of ranitidine requesting that they withdraw products from the market, and consumers are advised to stop taking any ranitidine tablets or liquid medications they currently have. The FDA said to dispose of them properly and not buy more. Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the FDA said don't return your medicines to a ""drug take-back location,"" but rather follow disposal instructions in the medication guide or insert -- or follow the FDA's recommended safe disposal steps on its website. Consumers who wish to continue treating their condition should consider using other approved medications, according to the FDA.  To date, the FDA has not found NDMA in some other products, such as famotidine or Pepcid, esomeprazole or Nexium, or omeprazole or Prilosec. For patients taking prescription ranitidine, the FDA said to talk to your doctor about other treatment options before stopping the medicine. ""There are multiple drugs approved for the same or similar uses as ranitidine that do not carry the same risks from NDMA,"" according to the FDA. In September, CVS Pharmacy, Walgreens and Walmart announced they would no longer sell Zantac and other over-the-counter ranitidine medications due to concerns they might contain NDMA. Then in October, drugmaker Sanofi voluntarily recalled Zantac OTC sold in the United States and Canada. At the time, the company said it issued the recall ""due to inconsistencies in preliminary test results."" "
Sailors from aircraft carrier hit by coronavirus outbreak to quarantine in Guam hotels,"Washington (CNN)Some of the sailors from the USS Theodore Roosevelt will be quarantined in hotel rooms in Guam as the number of coronavirus cases aboard the aircraft carrier approaches 100, a deteriorating situation that led the ship's commanding officer to issue a stark warning to top Navy leadership about the need to get sailors off the ship.CNN's Jason Carroll, Aaron Cooper and Mindy Agunon in Guam contributed to this report. Acting Secretary of the Navy Thomas Modly said Wednesday that 93 sailors from the ship have tested positive for the virus to date, representing more than 10% of all cases across the entire US military. A senior defense official told CNN that the Navy expected the number of cases to rise as more test results come in. Modly said 1,273 of the ship's roughly 4,800 crew members have been tested for the virus so far and the Navy was still awaiting the results of some of those tests.  He said about 1,000 sailors have been evacuated form the ship and moved ashore to Guam where the ship is currently in port. ""We already have nearly 1,000 personnel off the ship right now. And in the next couple of days we expect to have 2,700 of them off the ship,"" Modly told reporters at the Pentagon. Some sailors will have to remain on the ship The Chief of Naval Operations, Adm. Mike Gilday, said that the ship could not be evacuated in its entirety due to the need to continue to perform essential tasks such as the operation of the aircraft carrier's nuclear reactor.  He said that about 1,000 sailors would have to remain on the ship to perform, about 500 more than was proposed by the ship's commanding officer Capt. Brett Crozier in a recent memo. ""This ship has weapons on it, it has munitions on it, it has expensive aircraft, it has a nuclear power plant. It requires a certain amount of people on that ship to maintain the safety and security of the ship,"" Modly said. The outbreak on the ship is escalating rapidly. Last week the Pentagon confirmed three sailors on the Roosevelt had tested positive and that number had risen to 25 two days later. That number rose to at least 70 on Tuesday and nearly 100 on Wednesday. On Monday, a US defense official told CNN that a second US aircraft carrier, the USS Ronald Reagan, is also facing a ""handful"" of positive cases. As of Wednesday morning, 814 US service members in total had tested positive for the virus, according to the Pentagon. Senior Navy officials have said that the absence of housing capacity in Guam was one of the reasons that getting sailors off the ship was taking longer than Crozier would have liked. ""I know that our command organization has been aware of this for about 24 hours and we have been working actually the last seven days to move those sailors off the ship and get them into accommodations in Guam. The problem is that Guam doesn't have enough beds right now and were having to talk to the government there to see if we can get some hotel space, create tent-type facilities,"" Modly told CNN's John King Tuesday. Guam's Governor Lou Leon Guerrero said at a press conference Wednesday she will allow sailors from the ship to stay in vacant hotel rooms in Guam if they test negative for the virus and undergo a 14-day quarantine. She added that those sailors will continue to be required to have daily medical checks.  Navy officials have stressed that even if there was the capacity to evacuate all of the sailors that would not be possible due to the fact some sailors would be needed to stay aboard to operate the ship's nuclear reactor and perform other essential tasks. Sailor tells CNN 'more will get infected' A sailor assigned to the ship told CNN that more sailors are likely to be infected given how they are currently being housed.  The sailor, who had been moved off the ship to a makeshift dormitory in a gym in Guam, did not want to be identified speaking publicly without permission.  He has been in the converted gym since Saturday, along with more than 150 other sailors. Some of the people in his facility who were coughing and had fevers, but said they felt fine, later tested positive, he said. Other sailors who didn't show any symptoms later tested positive as well. There is no space in the gym to practice proper social distancing and they do not have proper cleaning supplies to decontaminate areas, he said.  ""More will get infected based on the current conditions -- not a matter of if, but when,"" he said.  CNN reported Tuesday that Crozier had warned Navy leadership that decisive action is required to save the lives of the ship's crew. ""We are not at war. Sailors do not need to die. If we do not act now, we are failing to properly take care of our most trusted asset — our Sailors,"" Crozier wrote in a memo to the Navy's Pacific Fleet, three US defense officials have confirmed to CNN. The commander of US Pacific Fleet declined to say how many sailors aboard the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier had tested positive for the virus but said that no one had been hospitalized.  ""What I will tell you is I have no sailors hospitalized, I have no sailors on ventilators, I have no sailors in critical condition, no sailors in an ICU status on the Theodore Roosevelt,"" Adm. John Aquilino told reporters Tuesday. This story has been updated with comments from a sailor who's been removed from the carrier. "
"Pence seeks to blame CDC, China for any delay in US coronavirus response -- not Trump's initial failure to face reality"," (CNN)Vice President Mike Pence sought to cast blame on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and China Wednesday when asked why the US was so late in understanding the enormity of the coronavirus pandemic.This story has been updated to include a statement from the White House coronavirus task force and additional reporting about the CDC's role. ""I will be very candid with you and say that in mid-January the CDC was still assessing that the risk of the coronavirus to the American people was low. The very first case, which was someone who had been in China -- in late January around the 20th day of January,"" Pence told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. Pence continued: ""The reality is that we could've been better off if China had been more forthcoming."" ""The reality is that China's been more transparent with respect to the coronavirus than certainly they were for other infectious diseases over the last 15 years,"" he said. ""But what appears evident now is long before the world learned in December, China was dealing with this, maybe as much as a month earlier than that."" A White House coronavirus task force spokesman denied that Pence was casting blame on the CDC's response efforts.  ""The CDC has been a major contributor to the Task Force and the whole-of-government response to the coronavirus outbreak. Vice President Pence has never cast blame on the CDC or any agency involved in the response efforts, and that did not change today,"" coronavirus task force spokesperson Devin O'Malley said in a statement to CNN.  US health officials from the CDC took active steps starting in January to prepare for the outbreak as information trickled out of China. Members of Trump's Cabinet also got involved and started briefing lawmakers. While public health officials and medical experts raised the alarm, Trump downplayed their concerns and injected controversial and unproven theories into the conversation.  In the course of two months, President Donald Trump has dramatically shifted his tone and level of optimism about the spread of novel coronavirus and its impact on the economy. At the coronavirus briefing on February 26, for example, Trump said all of the following: ""This is a flu. This is like a flu""; ""Now, you treat this like a flu""; ""It's a little like the regular flu that we have flu shots for. And we'll essentially have a flu shot for this in a fairly quick manner.""  As recently as the second week of March, Trump was an advocate of facing the virus without taking drastic measures to address it. Just four days ago, on March 27, he said that you can call the coronavirus ""a flu,"" or a virus or a germ. On Tuesday, the President warned of a ""painful"" and ""tough"" two-week stretch ahead as he extended nationwide distancing measures that -- even if followed closely -- could still mean more than 100,000 and up to 240,000 Americans die from coronavirus. Pence said Trump's past statements that seemed to downplay the coronavirus outbreak were based in optimism and the vice president denied Trump had minimized the crisis early on, despite repeated statements casting the virus as a problem that would be easily solved. ""I don't believe the President has ever belittled the threat of the coronavirus,"" Pence said. Given examples of the President doing just that -- either by comparing it favorably to the flu or auto accidents or by saying cases would get to zero quickly -- Pence said Trump was trying to maintain a rosy outlook. ""The President is an optimistic person,"" Pence told Blitzer. ""We've been from the very beginning, when the President suspended all travel from China and stood up the White House coronavirus task force in January, we have been hoping for the best but planning for the worst, and that's been being worked out every single day. And what the American people can see in this President every day is a leader who knows that we will get through this."" Pence also suggested that by continuing mitigation efforts to stop the spread of the virus, ""we could well have the coronavirus largely behind us as a nation"" by June.  ""I never want to minimize the loss. I just want to make sure people know there is light at the end of the tunnel,"" he added.  The vice president also said he doesn't think a national stay-at-home order is necessary. He said the administration supports orders like those made in California and in Washington (state), but suggested that they're not necessary across other parts of the country less affected by the coronavirus outbreak.

The $94 billion fitness industry is reinventing itself as Covid-19 spreads,"New York (CNN Business)As the coronavirus continues to spread, fitness studios around the country are shutting their doors and adjusting to a new reality. The sudden shift has inspired creativity and flexibility for gyms and studios, which are largely dependent on physical locations and on-site staff. The changes have rocked the fitness industry, which was worth $94 billion in 2018, according to The International Health, Racquet & Sportsclub Association.  Some studios -- such as Modo Yoga, which has locations in the United States, Canada, Australia and France -- are offering free classes on Instagram Live. Other studios, including SoulCycle, closed all of its locations globally, hoping to reopen when conditions improve and the curve flattens. The cult-favorite cycling studio doesn't have any online classes, but bikes are available for pre-order with a price tag of $2,500, and the company will release on-demand virtual classes later this year. And as gyms and boutique fitness studios continue to close, fitness instructors are getting creative and amping up their side hustles.  ""I've still been training clients that live in my building, though we've been using Lysol and in some cases latex gloves to be safe,"" Julie Verhage, a group fitness instructor at Equinox, said. Verhage also said that startups are reaching out to her and asking her to lead virtual workouts ""so they can still have team bonding while everyone is working remotely.""  Video classes ClassPass, a subscription service that partners with local boutique fitness classes, launched live workouts: More than 500 studios have added live, bookable classes to the platform, and 100% of livestream proceeds go directly to the studios. The company is also encouraging users to donate directly to their favorite studios through the ClassPass app, and the company is matching $1 million in donations.  A library of more than 2,000 pre-recorded audio and video workouts are also available for free -- without subscription -- on the ClassPass website.  ""The COVID-19 global pandemic has presented a challenge unlike any other that the health and wellness industry has seen,"" ClassPass CEO Fritz Lanman said in a statement. ""Almost 90% of our 30,000 gym, studio and wellness partners across 30 countries have indefinitely closed their physical locations.""  Jessica Goldman opened Dance Forever Studio in Chicago in 2005, but she recently closed her studio amid coronavirus concerns.  ""In the long term, the coronavirus will dilute the brick and mortar fitness industry model,"" Goldman told CNN Business in an email, adding that ""in an already crowded industry, the coronavirus will set the successful apart from the mediocre."" The disruption is pervasive Small studios are getting hit hard. In the hopes of reopening after closure, yoga studios like Sacred -- with locations in Brooklyn in Manhattan -- are charging $10 for virtual classes on Zoom. But some of the small studios probably won't recover, according to Nathan Forster, CEO of NEOU, an on-demand fitness video platform. ""I hope many of them can make it back, but there will definitely be some that don't,"" he told CNN Business in an email. Even big companies like Flywheel are trying to figure out how to navigate the financial hit to its business. On March 20, in a plea for money, the company sent an email to members, encouraging them to unfreeze their membership and continue paying a monthly fee even though the brick-and-mortar locations were closing. In March, the cycling company shut down the virtual classes that are connected to its in-home bikes, and Peloton is letting Flywheel customers swap out their bikes for a used Peloton bike for free. Many studios are creating YouTube video workouts in an effort to keep their clientele entertained and active. Cult-favorite HIIT studio Orange Theory, for instance, is sharing a free 30-minute workout on its website every day. It's not a smooth road for the studios that aren't accustomed to being primarily digital. Boston rowing studio The Row House offers a variety of free live-streamed classes on Facebook, but you can only participate in the classes if you have a rowing machine at home.  To bridge the gap, the company is offering members 60 days of free access to on-demand content for other fitness studios that share the same parent brand, Xponential Fitness, including Pilates, barre and yoga classes. Who benefits Meanwhile, virtual and digital fitness companies are benefiting from the industry shift. MIRROR, an interactive at-home fitness system that sells for $1,495 and looks like a full-length mirror, has seen an increase in sales.  ""Sales have more than doubled since the advent of Covid-19,"" MIRROR CEO Brynn Jinnett Putnam told CNN Business in an email. She added that MIRROR's team has been ""working around the clock to launch our digital product earlier than originally planned."" But it's not all uphill for primarily online fitness brands. MIRROR and Peloton both have brick-and-mortar studios. MIRROR closed its three showrooms -- one in New York City, one in Los Angeles, and one in Stanford California -- and Peloton closed its New York and London studios to the public, but the company will ""continue to produce live content without an audience,"" according to a statement from Peloton's co-founder and CEO John Foley. For online-only fitness services like Obé, business is booming. The service gives members unlimited access to 14 live classes a day and 4,000+ on-demand classes. It costs $27 per month or $199 per year.  Co-founders Mark Mullett and Ashley Mills said sales are soaring. ""We have seen a considerable increase in membership across the US in the last few weeks,"" he told CNN Business in an email. With an increasing number of parents and kids staying home, Obé released content for kids in partnership with KidzBop. "
"Before a Washington mother died of coronavirus, her six children used a walkie-talkie to say goodbye"," (CNN)Just weeks ago, Sundee Rutter was told she was beating breast cancer. But suddenly she was dying of a different disease, and her six children were saying goodbye -- from the other side of a window.CNN's Hollie Silverman contributed to this report. Rutter, 42, died on March 16 in Everett, Washington, after contracting coronavirus. Shortly before she passed, staff at Providence Hospital were keeping visitors out her room, hoping to prevent the virus's spread.  Her children, ages 13 to 24, were losing another parent, eight years after their father died. They gathered outside her hospital room, and staff came up with an arrangement to let them talk to her. ""They took a walkie-talkie, and they placed (it) right by her bedside, on the pillow,"" her son Elijah Ross-Rutter, 20, told CNN's Alisyn Camerota on Wednesday.  Looking at her through a window, ""We got to say our final words and goodbyes to our mom,"" he said. ""I was able to tell her I loved her,"" he said. ""It's kind of hard. In the moment, you really don't know what you're going to say, you know?"" Elijah said he told his mother that ""everything's going to be all right with the kids."" ""Us older siblings, we're going to make sure everything's OK with (the younger ones) and that they're going to grow up to be some adults that my mom would want them to be,"" he recalled. 'We were just starting to feel whole again' Rutter had been battling breast cancer, but was told in January she was in remission, her family has said. ""We were just starting to feel whole again,"" her son told CNN. She began to feel ill on March 2 -- she was weak, had trouble breathing and had a migraine. Her son said he first took her to a hospital on March 3. That first time, she was there four to five hours, but returned when her condition worsened. ""She fought valiantly until she could not fight any more,"" a GoFundMe page set up on behalf of the family says. Elijah's eldest brother, Tyree Ross-Rutter, intends to take custody of his younger siblings, ages 13, 14 and 15. ""We plan on staying together, and all getting a house together ... and fighting this all together,"" Elijah said. So far, the GoFundMe has raised more than its $350,00 goal from nearly 8,000 donors. The organizer of the fundraiser, Carrie Frederickson, wrote that the money helped Tyree afford the attorneys needed to settle his mother's estate and start the guardianship process for his three youngest siblings. ""In such a dark time for these six siblings, you are the ray of light that they needed,"" Frederickson wrote. Sundee Rutter's older sister, Shawnna Olsen, called Sundee a ""hero"" who always put her children first. Rutter had been a single mother since the death of her husband in 2012, Olsen said.  ""My sister was amazing,"" Olsen said. ""She was the first to lend a helping hand to anyone."" The children ""are well loved by family, community and complete strangers,"" Olsen said. "
Coronavirus is testing the power of unionized newsrooms,"New York (CNN Business)Since joining at The Arizona Republic in 2008, reporter Rebekah Sanders has seen many rounds of layoffs, buyouts and furloughs at the Gannett-owned newspaper.  ""Every single time I felt helpless,"" Sanders told CNN Business. ""There was nothing that I could do. I could go home and be angry. I could complain to my coworkers, but I had no power to make any kind of change to the situation."" But on Monday, after Sanders learned of Gannett's furlough plan — requiring employees making more than $38,000 to take five days unpaid in April, May and June —  she didn't feel helpless like she did in the past. The Arizona Republic is one of more than 30 unionized newsrooms under Gannett ownership, represented by the NewsGuild.  ""We deserve better than this. Having a union allows you to [ask for] that in a coordinated way. I would never know what's going on in Eugene, Oregon, Rochester, Jacksonville and Milwaukee, except that I have friends now in all of those newsrooms. We're all sharing information and talking about how we can best serve our journalists,"" Sanders said.  Over the last few years, a wave of unionization has swept local newsrooms and digital media outlets. As the coronavirus sweeps the country, forcing media companies to enact drastic cost-cutting plans, unionized newsrooms are putting the power of collective bargaining to the test.  NewsGuild's stimulus plan Action plans aren't just being formed within individual newsrooms. On Wednesday, the NewsGuild-CWA, which represents thousands of media workers in the US and Canada, called for public stimulus funds for the media industry, NewsGuild president Jon Schleuss told CNN Business. The plan, passed unanimously by the labor union's executive council, calls for federal, state, provincial and local governments to provide public funds to sustain newsrooms.  ""We're calling for a stimulus plan that would protect the fourth estate and protect the work because it's an essential service,"" Schleuss said. ""It's really about public health, and it's about trying to do this in the interest of our communities who are desperate for this information at this critical moment."" The stimulus plan has certain stipulations for employers who request public funds. For example, executives are not allowed to take bonuses, stock options or ""golden parachutes"" for five years. An executive's compensation also cannot be more than twice as much as that of an editor in chief's.  ""We entered the pandemic without enough people to cover this story [because] private equity and hedge funds have used [media] as a distressed asset situation to just take as much money as they can,"" Schleuss said. ""That's terrible for our communities."" Union protections Labor unions have gained traction at newspapers and digital media outlets in recent years as staffers witnessed round after round of layoffs even as traffic soared on some sites. This created unstable work environments that called for job protections, better benefits and severance packages. Thrillist staffers announced their intention to unionize with the Writers Guild of America, East in early 2017 after approximately 20 employees were laid off. BuzzFeed voted to unionize in early 2019 after 15% of its workforce, or about 220 people, were laid off.  Other newsroom unions have existed for decades. The Knoxville Newspaper Guild, which includes staffers of the Knoxville News-Sentinel, formed in 1936. The Arizona Republic, meanwhile, voted to unionize in October, seeking workplace protections prior to the merger of newspaper conglomerates Gannett and GateHouse.  Gary White, union chair of the Gannett-owned Lakeland Ledger, told CNN Business that since the paper unionized in 2016, they have had two ""modest raises,"" frozen health care premiums, received two more personal days and secured ""just-cause protection, when previously management could fire employees at will."" Indeed, Gannett journalists said they have witnessed their newsrooms shrink drastically in recent years. Travis Dorman, union president of the Knoxville News-Sentinel, said his newsroom lost six reporters and only hired one over the last six months. Andrew Pantazi, union co-chair at the Florida Times Union Guild, said that since GateHouse bought the Jacksonville-based paper in 2017 the newsroom staff has dropped from 62 to 28 people.  Some unions have successfully pushed back against layoffs. Pantazi said his paper's union prevented two layoffs last year. Sanders of The Arizona Republic said they negotiated buyouts rather than layoffs at the end of last year.  ""One of the most affirming things about why this union effort was successful is one of our retirees on the last day went by every single desk in the newsroom saying goodbye,"" Sanders said. ""That maybe seems small in the scheme of things, but to give people the opportunity to leave on their own terms in an industry that is cratering is actually a pretty big deal.""  Unions during coronavirus  Since Monday's news, union chairs across Gannett newsrooms have been been in constant communication with each other through phone calls, Zoom video conference calls, texts, emails and Google Hangouts to discuss action plans. Initially, some unionized newsrooms were planning to bargain collectively. But according to two union chairs, Gannett declined the opportunity. Still, Gannett staffers are working together behind the scenes to plan their individual bargaining discussions with management and other tactics.  ""Journalists in some sense are the most ideal union members because we are trained to question authority, to research the data, to hold power to account and that's all we're doing,"" Sanders said.  Given the already shrunken staffs at newsrooms, Gannett reporters told CNN Business that they are fearful for the effects of the furloughs. Pantazi likened the plan to cut hours by 25% each month to reducing the amount of reporting by 25%. He worries that the cuts could spell trouble for communities hard hit by the coronavirus pandemic.  ""We're concerned that in the middle of a crisis we're going to see 25% less stories about how people can stay safe, how people can get tested as well as 25% less accountability of government organizations that have not been handling this crisis well and companies that have been exploiting this crisis,"" Pantazi said.  Though, not every staffer will be furloughed since the plan requires employees to make at least $38,000. Dorman of the Knoxville News-Sentinel said about little less than half his staff of 23 reporters and photographers make under $38,000, including himself. Austin White, union chair of the Pueblo Chieftain, said three out of eight reporters would not be furloughed and that these employees would not be eligible for overtime pay.  ""People are going to have to make up for other people's work that won't be there or just have a horrible output,"" White said. ""I don't understand how you can get away with no overtime."" A Gannett spokesperson told CNN Business that under the company's policies, furloughed employees could be eligible paid overtime as long as it is approved by their managers.  One concern union chairs have is Gannett's lack of due diligence in reviewing other cost-cutting options. For example, while Gannett CEO Paul Bascobert announced he would not take salary until the furloughs were over, there was no mention of the company's other CEO, Mike Reed, taking a pay cut.  A Gannett spokesperson said Reed is not employed by Gannett, but by Fortress Investment Group, the private equity firm in New York that manages the newly combined company. Sanders said she hopes to relax freelance restrictions, allowing furloughed staffers to write for other outlets as another source of income.  In the meantime, some papers have organized relief funds, and others are considering similar efforts. Pantazi said the Florida Times Union had raised about $10,000 as of Tuesday.  ""It's going to help our members if they do get any pay cuts to be able to make their rent, to be able to pay for their medicine, to be able to cover the expenses that they've been accruing,"" Pantazi said. ""That's going to help us take care of our coworkers, even as we continue to fight to have the least amount of reduction in reporting as possible."" "
Analysis: Devin Nunes needs to stop talking about the coronavirus," (CNN)On the same day that President Donald Trump acknowledged that somewhere between 100,000 and 200,000 Americans were likely to die because of the coronavirus, California Republican Rep. Devin Nunes went on Fox News to offer a very, uh, different perspective. THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! In each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! ""Let's stop looking at the death counters and let's talk about how we can keep as many people employed as possible,"" Nunes told Fox anchor Laura Ingraham. ""That's the key right now, Laura, because if you don't, what you said earlier is correct. When you have people staying at home, not taking care of themselves, you will end up with a hell of a lot more people dying by other causes than you will by the coronavirus."" Which is bad enough! But Nunes wasn't done! Far from it! (Also, shout-out to my producer Alli Gordon for transcribing this whole interview!) ""I mean, look, the schools were just canceled out here in California which is way overkill,"" he added. ""It's possible kids could've went back to school in two weeks to four weeks but they just canceled the rest of the schools."" And then there was this: ""If we don't start to get people back to work in this country over the next week to two weeks, I don't believe we can wait until the end of April. I just don't know of any economy that's ever survived where you unplug the entire economy and expect things to go back and be normal."" It's as though Nunes is living in some alternate universe here. In Nunes' world, kids need to be going back to school. More people will die from staying home than returning to normal and spreading (or catching) the coronavirus! The economy will fail unless we start sending people back to work in two weeks! Nunes is not -- and this fact may surprise you -- a doctor. Or an infectious disease expert. All of whom have pushed Trump to extend the social distancing guidelines in place for another month. And who have forced Trump to publicly admit that, even if we follow those guidelines to a T, we could well lose hundreds of thousands of Americans to the virus. Of course, this isn't the first time Nunes has pushed information publicly that goes directly against the advice from the medical community about how best to deal with the spread of coronavirus. In mid-March, Nunes told Fox Business anchor Maria Bartiromo this:  ""There's a lot of concerns with the economy here, because people are scared to go out. But I will just say, one of the things you can do, if you're healthy, you and your family, it's a great time to just go out, go to a local restaurant, likely you can get in, get in easily."" Even at that time what Nunes was suggesting -- go out to eat because it will be easy to get a table since so many people are staying in -- was directly opposed to the guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and the Trump administration, which was encouraging staying at home and certainly not gathering in a restaurant (or anywhere else) with crowds. Then, days later, Nunes was back at it in an interview with a California conservative radio host. Nunes accused the media of twisting his words in the interview with Bartiromo; ""Don't say that I was telling people to go out to bars and drink and go to discotheques and whatever other nonsense they were doing,"" he scolded.  And he offered up another pearl of wisdom, questioning the infectiousness of coronavirus:  ""If this virus is really spreading like some people say that it is, we don't have any data on that, but if it is spreading, think how much it is spreading all over the country right now with hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people going into grocery stores, OK?"" The problem here -- OK, one of the problems here -- is that Nunes isn't some random dude shouting these things on his porch. He is the ranking minority member on the House Intelligence Committee, and he is broadcasting these, uh, views, on Fox's umbrella of news networks, which are the default information source for large numbers of conservatives in the country. All of which makes what Nunes is doing not just irresponsible but actively dangerous to the health and well-being of Americans right now. "
The next hit to your retirement fund: Disappearing dividends,"London (CNN Business)Pension funds and other investors are smarting from the worst quarter for stocks since 2008. Now many are bracing for more pain as companies slash dividend payouts in the face of a global recession that is wiping out their revenue and putting millions of their workers out of a job.   Banks have already started ditching payments worth billions of dollars, and so have companies in other industries. The cuts are a sign of just how big a hit the coronavirus has been for global businesses, which delivered a record $1.4 trillion in dividends last year.  ""We're getting companies suspending or cutting dividends every single day at the moment,"" said Jane Shoemake, investment director on the global equity income team at Janus Henderson, an asset manager that tracks global dividends. Goldman Sachs estimates that S&P 500 (DVS) dividends will decline by 25% this year. Citigroup, meanwhile, thinks dividends in Europe — which are typically more generous than in the United States — could be cut in half. Pressure to slice dividends is coming from many sources: In the United States, companies that accept federal bailouts or loans to survive the coronavirus crisis are barred from paying dividends in the near term, while regulators are calling on banks to preserve capital so they can keep lending to businesses and offer mortgage holidays to households. UK banks including HSBC (HBCYF), Standard Chartered (SCBFF) and Lloyds (LLDTF) have halted dividend payments following a request from the country's financial services regulator. Their shares plunged on Wednesday, pushing the FTSE 100 (UKX) index down more than 3%. For the retail, hospitality and energy sectors — which have seen revenue dry up completely in some places — it's about holding onto enough cash to tide them over until the lockdowns lift and the economy can start to recover. ""It's all about the balance sheet right now,"" said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. A looming 'wave' of cuts Dividend payments have exploded since the global financial crisis as steady economic growth and President Donald Trump's corporate tax cut in 2017 left companies flush with cash. Executives binged on buying back shares and boosting dividends, which reward investors while boosting the value of the company's stock.  In 2019, dividend payments rose by 3.5% to hit $1.4 trillion, an all-time high, according to Janus Henderson.  Companies usually try to preserve those payments at all costs. Shareholders can be punishing if they backpedal. That's especially true in the oil sector, where dividends are the main prize keeping investors committed to an industry with limited opportunities for growth. But faced with an oil price crash, a sharp recession and the prospect of having to layoff or furlough employees, companies have few options but to retrench. Goldman Sachs strategists Cole Hunter and David Kostin told clients this week that ""a wave of dividend suspensions, cuts, and eliminations will result in payouts declining by 38% during the next nine months."" In Europe, dividends cuts could be even worse than during the global financial crisis, when they fell by a third, according to Citigroup strategist Robert Buckland. Under pressure Those hit the hardest by the pandemic have quickly moved to stop dividend payments in a bid to conserve cash. Carnival (CCL), which is trying to tap capital markets for $6 billion as the cruise industry implodes, halted its dividend on Tuesday.  Companies also have public opinion to consider at a moment when shareholder handouts are politically charged. Continuing to make dividend payments while cutting employees loose would pose a major reputational risk. ""To be seen to be paying out a big dividend when all of this is going on, it could not be taken very well,"" Janus Henderson's Shoemake said. Macy's (M) suspended its dividend on March 20 before announcing that it would furlough most of its 125,000 employees earlier this week. Access to government bailouts is a factor, too. Under the $2 trillion stimulus bill enacted by the United States last week, businesses that take advantage of a new $500 billion lending program can't issue dividends until a year after the loan has been repaid. Airlines that receive US assistance aren't permitted to make such payments through September.  The situation is slightly different for banks. Regulators have assured the public that lenders have the capital necessary to get them through the crash without sparking a new financial crisis. But they're encouraging banks to pause dividends anyway so they can boost lending, helping to power the economy through this vulnerable moment. The European Central Bank has asked banks not to pay dividends until at least October ""to boost banks' capacity to absorb losses and support lending to households, small businesses and corporates.""  UniCredit (UNCFF), Italy's top bank, quickly said it would fall in line. Big Oil holds out In the oil sector, where dividends are sacrosanct, the biggest players are doing their best to stay the course despite the 63% collapse in oil prices since early January. ""Through the last downturn they did whatever they could to avoid cutting their dividends,"" said Anish Kapadia, director of energy at the consultancy Palissy Advisors, referring to a plunge in oil prices between 2014 and 2016. Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) hasn't slashed its dividend since World War II, and it's going to extraordinary lengths to avoid doing so now. The company said this week it has secured a $12 billion line of credit, which comes on top of a $10 billion credit facility obtained in December. But taking on more debt at such a precarious moment could be dangerous, and it's not an option for all oil companies, Kapadia said. They could reduce spending on equipment, but they already sold a lot of what they could during the last oil shock. If prices stay this low, the product of a price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia and evaporating demand, cash levels could be low enough to force Big Oil's hand. ""As you go on through the year, the prospect of dividend cuts becomes much higher,"" Kapadia said. Some companies, such as those in tech, health care and utilities, will be less affected by the coronavirus outbreak and could stay the course. But in the current environment, it's hard to say which payouts are safe — especially when the outlook is so uncertain. ""Even companies that could pay dividends may not do so,"" Citigroup's Buckland said. ""Better to build cash on the balance sheet to deal with potential pitfalls ahead."" "
Checking in with Dr. Fauci: Dr. Gupta's coronavirus podcast for April 1," (CNN)Dr. Anthony Fauci has become one of the most recognizable names in the fight against the novel coronavirus pandemic. CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta talks to Fauci about his personal life, career and navigating his current position straddling both science and politics.  Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases: This is so different, Sanjay, than any anything else that I've experienced, despite the, you know, 40-plus years I've been doing this.  Dr. Sanjay Gupta: That's Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a member of the White House coronavirus task force. He's now one of the most recognizable leaders fighting this pandemic.  Fauci's signature gravelly voice -- a result of the copious press conferences, briefings and interviews he's been doing -- combined with his calm, evidence-based assurances, have become such a comfort to Americans lately that when he missed two White House briefings in a row, the hashtag #whereisdrfauci started trending on Twitter.  Even at the age of 79, the nation's top infectious disease doctor has been working around the clock. But he found time to talk to me for this episode.  I'm Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's Chief Medical Correspondent. And this is ""Coronavirus: Fact vs. Fiction."" We've seen Dr. Fauci in front of the cameras at the White House briefings answering reporters' questions. His advice to the nation has had a profound effect on how we are all navigating this crisis.  But behind the cameras, when he's not working, Tony Fauci and his family are adapting to this new reality much like the rest of us.  I asked him how he's coping on a personal level.  Dr. Fauci: You know, I'm doing fine, Sanjay. It's very exhausting. I think maybe about three or four weeks ago, I realized that I was really running myself completely into the ground. And it was the wisdom of my wife -- who is the head of the Department of Bioethics at the NIH but before that she was a nurse and still is a nurse, and she's a pretty good clinician -- and she sort of said, ""Tony, you just got to really be careful because you're going to burn out in about a week."" So, with that, what I did is, I didn't say, pull back, but I started to make sure that I ate. Like, I would go a whole day without eating anything just because I was so busy, I just didn't have time to eat. And the adrenalin was so high that it doesn't make you hungry. And then I find that at the end of the day, I'm feeling hypoglycemic and I don't know why. And then my wife goes, ""Duh, you're hypoglycemic because you didn't eat anything."" And it's the same thing with sleep. So, I'm really trying now, to the best as possible, to get five hours. I was getting three to four, which doesn't work for me, Sanjay. I'm not at my best at three to four.   Dr. Gupta: Right. I mean, I think nobody would be. And even five, as you know, is probably not enough. I know you probably don't have time to run and do things like that, because I know you're very active, but would you run outside?   Dr. Fauci: You know, I would. I mean that there's a little bit of a, I wouldn't say controversy, but there's something we need to sort out here, because, by the way last night, I got back from the White House press conference a little bit earlier because it was less of going on and on and on and on the way it happens sometimes. And so she and I went out for a run last night in (the) dark.  Dr. Gupta: Really?  Dr. Fauci: Yeah. And that answers your question. You know, we're telling people to hunker down, stay in. And then on the other hand, it just makes sense that if you don't want to go stir crazy, if you can get outside and really physically separate yourself, don't just go outside and congregate and see the neighbors and schmooze. But actually, just go out. So, my wife and I went out last night and you know, on the streets of Washington -- we live in northwest DC -- the streets of Washington were essentially deserted. We passed a few people. We passed them well beyond 6 feet of physical separation. So, frankly, Sanjay, I don't see anything wrong with that.   Dr. Gupta: You have had medicine and health in your family for a long time. You grew up in Brooklyn. Your family owned a pharmacy. Was that what sort of inspired you to go into medicine?   Dr. Fauci: You know, a little bit, Sanjay. I don't think overwhelming. Probably the thing that got me to go into medicine is that I'm very much of a people person. But also, I'm very analytical and I'm very scientific. And I was trying to figure out how do you, how do you mesh those two together? How do you do something that's evidence-based, science-based but absolutely has to do with people? You know, I grew up as an Italian-American Catholic boy from Brooklyn. I had Jesuit training my entire educational career. And the one theme that was always underlying our interactions was service for others. So, if you put science, I like people, service for others -- that was medicine. It was the NIH, when I went down to the NIH that got me introduced to science that got me involved with what I'm doing now. Fundamentally, I'm a physician. And, and when I think of my identity, it's a physician.  Dr. Gupta: Well, I think everybody in the world thinks of you that way, Dr. Fauci. Let me let me ask a couple questions about December of 2019. When you first heard about this novel coronavirus, the early reports out of China, what was your initial response?   Dr. Fauci: I was concerned, but it was a muted concern. In fact, it goes back even before it was discovered to be a coronavirus because we were hearing these reports of a strange pulmonary illness out of China that may be associated with wet markets. When I heard it was a coronavirus, the only thing I said -- not the only thing, but one of the things I said -- to myself: ""Let's hope that it remains difficult to readily transmit from human to human."" In an interview, I don't even know when, but something that you interviewed me 20 years ago, whenever it was, you asked me, ""What keeps you up at night? What worries you?"" And if you go back, I told you, I said: ""It's a respiratory-borne illness. It may be influenza, but maybe it isn't influenza that has multiple characteristics. One, it's readily transmissible from human to human. And two, it has a high degree of morbidity and mortality."" That's the nightmare that everybody who's in infectious diseases always worries about. And here we are in, you know, in 2020, it's happened.   Dr. Gupta: You know, it's interesting because I remember that conversation well, and I think it's really affected how I report about all of these outbreaks, epidemics and even pandemics over the last 20 years now. And in January 2017, you gave a talk at Georgetown University about the challenges the next administration might face. And you said there is going to be a surprise outbreak. That was incredibly spot on. You were prophetic on this. Why were you so convinced there would be a surprise outbreak?  Dr. Fauci: Well, you know, that was a lecture I put together at the end of the Obama administration because I reflected back that I had advised five presidents up to that time. And I noticed with some curiosity and impending concern that every one of the presidents that I've dealt with have been confronted with a substantial public health crisis. You know, Reagan with HIV into George H.W. Bush with HIV. You know, Clinton had a couple of West Nile and a few other things. Then, George W. With anthrax and then again with Ebola, and then Obama with Ebola. And then I said, you know, ""It's eerie, but I don't know what it's gonna be. But as we enter into this new administration, there's no doubt in my mind that we're going to get challenged with an unexpected outbreak."" I didn't anticipate it would be as bad as this, but it certainly is unexpected.  Dr. Gupta: This is not at all a political question, but I'm just wondering in terms of style, you have spent so much time with so many different presidents. Is it typically the same sort of way of interacting? Do you make appointments and you meet in the Oval Office? Is there a certain casualness or is there always a formality to it? How do you describe those meetings?  Dr. Fauci: You know, they're different with every president, Sanjay. And within a given presidency, it's different. You know, I mean, I could give so many different examples. With George H.W. Bush, just by accident I developed a really close friendship with him because he came to the NIH in the in the late '80s when he was vice president and was thinking of running for president. And he sincerely wanted to learn about HIV. He was a very modest, unbelievable human being. And he came in, he says, ""I want to learn."" So, he came to the NIH and I gave him a bit of a tutorial on HIV. I introduced him to patients, et cetera. He was very struck by that. And all of a sudden, he decided he was going to be my friend. Thank goodness. And he invited me to the White House, and we had a very warm, personal-type relationship. That was different. I mean, with Clinton, Clinton had all the right vibes about what to do. I had a good relationship with him, but it was quite formal, as you would have with respect to the presidency. With George W. Bush, I mean, it started off in crises because we had 9/11. We had anthrax. So, I got to know him under crises situation. And then subsequent to that, you know, I had the privilege of being close to him and developing PEPFAR, which to me was one of the most important things any American president has ever done.   Dr. Gupta: For our listeners, can you just tell us, what that is?  Dr. Fauci: PEPFAR is the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, which was established by President Bush in 2003, in which he marshaled an extraordinary amount of resources to help the people in the developing world, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, who were challenged with an amazing degree of pain and suffering with HIV AIDS. I believe it is one of the most important mandates from a United States president in history because it saved millions of lives. So, a lot of credit goes to President George W. Bush for doing that. With Obama, Obama, you know, just a very easy person to get along with and a really good human being. And we had multiple crises. We had Ebola, we had Zika.  Dr. Gupta: H1N1 --  Dr. Fauci: Yeah, it was a marathon of infec--, of you know, he even, he didn't joke about it because he was serious. But I remember once he walked into the Situation Room and we were sitting around and he just put his hand on his head. He said, ""I got, I got children at the border, I got wars going on, and I'm spending all my time with these diseases. Would you guys please do something about this?"" It was, it was sort of like almost tongue-in-cheek, but it was serious. And then now, we're faced here. You know, I had no interaction with President Trump for the first three-plus years because there was not any reason to interact. We were doing our job. You know, he was doing what he was doing. And then when this came along, all of a sudden, now I'm in a situation where I spend like more than an hour every day with him. I mean, we go there, we brief him, we have a press conference, we debrief after the press conference. And it's like the answer to your question, a little bit long-winded, is that it's very different with each president, and it's dictated almost completely by the circumstances that you're under.  Dr. Gupta: Do you feel like you're being listened to? And let me give a little context to the question, because this is just my own observation as we talk on this podcast, that I feel like you've known a lot of the answers and a lot of the strategic direction things are gonna go earlier than sometimes you let on. I'm just going to throw that out there. And I wonder, is that a stylistic thing? Is that a strategic thing? Am I totally off base?  Dr. Fauci: No. In many respects, you're correct. You have to be discussing and presenting things in a way that people would appreciate it and accept it. I mean, sometimes if you come out and you get this instinct that it's going to be this way and most of the times your instinct is right, mostly because you have a lot of experience, you've got to be careful that you don't get ahead of what the facts and the data are, because then people will think you're just winging it, you know, you're shooting from the hip.  Dr. Gupta: You knew it seems that when this, this 15-day pause was first recommended that it was gonna have to be longer than that. If for no other reason that the data was going to catch up. Was the intent to sort of, let's slow-roll this, not let's not jar the country too much and let them accept it a bit more slowly?  Dr. Fauci: Yeah. It was a combination of a couple of things, Sanjay, you're absolutely correct. I was totally convinced that we would have to go beyond that. But there were a lot of forces that were, you know, conflicting. You know, if you keep it going longer, there's a lot of economic issues. If you don't, you might be responsible for making things worse than they were. I put all the economic things off my table. I said, you know, I care about the health and the economy of the country, but my job is the health of the nation. So, what I did was instead of coming out and trying to get ahead of everybody and saying, ""I know now that 15 days from now we're gonna have to go longer."" It was, ""It's going to happen. Let's discuss it in a way that it happens."" And it worked. Because when we presented the information to the president, he was -- this is (Dr.) Deb Birx and I -- that we went and presented it to him, he was very receptive to it. I mean, the thought that there'd be a lot of pushback, ""Oh, no, no, no."" And he said it. He said, you know, ""The most important thing is the health of the country."" So, I mean, I don't like the idea that we're going to have to do it longer. But if it's got to be done, it's got to be done.   Dr. Gupta: Does this feel especially strange for you?   Dr. Fauci: Oh, yeah. It's so, it's just different. I mean, the intensity of it, the potential for, you know, the fight, you know, it really looks like an ongoing war. You know, the, the dynamics of the virus against our attempts to mitigate it. And it's just it's, it's really intense. You know, hopefully we'll get through this. But it's, it's tough-going, man. This is an unusual disease. I'm fascinated, Sanjay, by what I would call the pathogenesis. You know, you get so many people who do well and then some people who just, bingo, they're on a respirator, they're on ECMO (a life-support machine) and they're dead. I mean, the dichotomy between that, there's something there, Sanjay, that we're missing from a pathogenesis standpoint. And I don't think it's only if you're elderly or if you have underlying conditions. There's something else going on there that hopefully we'll ultimately figure out.  Dr. Gupta: You know, you and I are both medical professionals. We're bonded by that. And I have to say that maybe you heard the story of Dr. James Goodrich, a pediatric neurosurgeon who died of Covid. We don't know for sure how he contracted it. But I found it really challenging, Dr. Fauci, to see what our health care professionals are going through, what they're talking about in terms of the lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) and then having to go home and worried about infecting their families. How about you? How have you sort of worked through that in your own mind?   Dr. Fauci: I'm doing everything I possibly can. And I'm not alone. I'm not the only person. There are a lot of good people that are trying to do that to make absolutely certain that we don't get to that point where people are putting themselves into even greater danger than the situation, even when you're optimally prepared with PPEs and everything you need, you are still putting yourself in danger. I mean, we've got to make sure regardless of what it takes, I mean, pull out all the stops, which I think we're doing. To me, that is the absolute highest priority to protect the health workers who are putting their lives on the line every day.  Dr. Gupta: We've done a lot of reporting about masks and the advice, really, from the World Health Organization, from the CDC: Healthy people don't need them. If you're sick, you should be staying inside anyway. But if you have to go out, then you can wear a mask. China, they said, you know, basically everyone should wear a mask at least in Wuhan. Do you think that we should be wearing a mask? Not a medical mask -- we don't want to take away from health care providers -- but even a cloth mask or anything to reduce the likelihood that we might be spreading the virus?  Dr. Fauci: If you look back, this whole story of masks has been confounded and conflated with things that I think have created a little bit of confusion, because the issue is that if everybody wears a mask and you don't have enough masks, the health care workers who need them may not get it. But that has driven the conversation, I think, to an extreme, because it says, ""Well, you know, masks are not that effective in preventing you from infecting somebody else or infecting somebody else, affecting somebody else in their ability to infect you."" It's not perfect, but I think this is one of those times where we need to relook at it because although it isn't a 100% protected, if you have enough masks that you don't take away from the people who really need them, i.e. the health care workers, I think we should seriously consider the pros and the cons of maybe modifying our stance on whether people should be wearing masks because something doesn't have to be 100% effective to be beneficial.   Dr. Gupta: Will you recommend it?  Dr. Fauci: You know, from what I've seen, Sanjay, I think that if we do not have the problem of taking away masks from the health care workers who need them, I would lean towards it because, I mean, what harm can it do if you have enough masks?  Dr. Gupta: You know, it's interesting. You know, many years ago when I was back in residency, we made a decision to not shave (patients') hair as much as possible when we were doing brain operations. And part of the thinking was it doesn't really make a difference, really, in terms of their recovery. It's either shaving their hair or not. But it was the way they felt, and we found that in our own small study that people who did not have their head shaved actually recovered more quickly. They were more likely to be out of bed the next day, up and about, whatever it might be. The optics of masks, how much of that concerns you? Does it make it look like we are a nation that is sick?  Dr. Fauci: You know, that was part of the conversation. If everybody wears a mask, does that look like we're all frightened of each other? But, you know, the people in Asia have been doing that long before coronavirus, and it's become part of their culture. I mean, is it good? Is it bad? I think it's neither. It's neither good nor bad. They've just integrated that into their culture. And, you know, as I said, I cannot imagine it's doing harm and it might be doing some good.  Dr. Gupta: You know, I have found myself at times toggling between bewilderment and anger sometimes, especially given that it does seem like so many things were done right at the beginning. But then wondering if that time wasn't spent well. We knew how many masks were gonna likely be needed. We knew how many ventilators based on the federal government's modeling. Were there missed opportunities, do you think?  Dr. Fauci: You know, it's complicated. I mean, obviously, there probably were some missed opportunities, but I don't think that's the prevailing theme here. You know, I go back years and years when we got involved in pandemic preparedness. You know, if you would have said to anybody, ""What we really need is tens and tens of thousands, not 12.5 thousand, but tens and tens and tens of thousands of ventilators,"" there would not have been a lot of support for that. I got to tell you, there would not have been. Or, ""We've got to mobilize the industry to make a billion masks."" I mean, now when you look back, we say, ""Oh, my God, why didn't we do it? So that we can not only give the masks to every health care worker who needs it, but if we want to go out and even have everybody in the community put a mask on."" I mean, looking back retrospectively, it would have been nice. But I remember back before all this happened. I mean, there was good preparedness, but it wasn't the kind of thing we wish we had now.  Dr. Gupta: We don't think of our health care system with that sort of redundancy, I guess. If anything, the number of hospital beds that we have in the country may be even lower now than it was a decade or two ago. We do have a lot of redundancy in areas like defense.  Dr. Fauci: Right.  Dr. Gupta: Should we have this sort of redundancy? Isn't this a kind of defense and war as well?  Dr. Fauci: Sanjay, you're asking the question and preaching to the choir here. I mean, this is what I've spent the last almost 40 years arguing: that even though it is very difficult to get support for something that hasn't happened yet, it will happen, and then you will be kicking yourself that you didn't do that. And I think you used the right word. I had not heard it before, but I'm going to start using it now and that is ""redundancy."" You're absolutely correct. There was very little redundancy to face a challenge like this. It's almost like you get one shot at it. If you don't knock it down, you run out (of) ammunition. You can't run out of ammunition. You can't run out of ammunition.  Dr. Gupta: You think we've learned that lesson? Do you think it will be applied in the future?  Dr. Fauci: Oh, I hope so, Sanjay. I mean, you know, when this is over -- and it will be over -- I think what we need to do is, is not just do a ""lessons learned"" paper that you write and stick in a drawer but really shake ourselves by the collars and say, ""Whoa, you know, look what we just went through. This cannot happen again.""  Dr. Gupta: Is there something about this particularly that concerns you the most? That keeps you awake at night?   Dr. Fauci: Yeah. What I'm concerned about is we don't know the full impact of its ability to infect. You know there are probably a lot of people who are infected who we don't know, who are asymptomatic. I'm concerned about if this circles out into the developing world. I mean, Africa could be a disaster. Certain parts of the developing world of Asia could be a disaster. Caribbean, some parts of South America. So, we're in a developed world now. You're seeing China, USA, Europe. I'm looking about what might happen the rest of the world. That's very troublesome.   Dr. Gupta: I have three daughters, I think as, as you know. And do you have three daughters as well?   Dr. Fauci: I do, Sanjay. I have three daughters. Yes.  Dr. Gupta: That's another way we are connected here. But my daughters, you know, I've been thinking about them a lot and, and sort of imagine that this this event, what is happening right now with this coronavirus, is going to have a lifelong impact on them, not necessarily physically but I think in terms of how they see the world and the way that they act. How much of an impact do you think this is going to leave even after the pandemic is gone?  Dr. Fauci: I think it's going to be profound, Sanjay. I really do. I could hear it in the inflections in my daughters' voices when I speak with them on the phone. This is going to be imprinted on the personality of our nation for a very long time. I think this is going to be something that will be with them and have some impact, subconsciously or otherwise, for a very long time in their lives.   Dr. Gupta: Do you think that when we get the all-clear, for lack of a better way of describing it, that it's going to feel like it's all clear, or are people still going to be frightened, do you think, to push the elevator button, to shake a hand, to do whatever?  Dr. Fauci: Well, I actually think, I'm not a psychiatrist, so I don't want to go into that realm, but I think that when we do get the all clear, in some respects, there'll be relief, but I think there's going to be some subliminal post-traumatic stress syndrome that we're all going to face.  Dr. Gupta: You know, when you go out for a run with your wife at night, people probably don't stop you because they know they should keep their distance and you're running pretty fast. But if people stop you and ask you for your best advice, given all that's going on, Dr. Fauci, what do you tell them?  Dr. Fauci: You know what I tell them, and actually, interesting you should ask that, because that happened last night as I was, was running with my wife. Someone did stop and I said, you know, hang in there. This is really a painful, difficult time for our nation. But we're a strong nation and we've been through things in our history that is worse than this. And yet we've come through. There's going to be an end to this. You know, we're in the middle of it, but there will be an end so hang in there and pull together. And that's what we need to each of us need to tell everybody that. That's how we talk to each other. Dr. Gupta: I really admire you, Dr. Fauci. I really appreciate your service. I've tried to say that every time I get a chance to speak to you and I really mean it. You've instructed the world on this. You've instructed me, personally. And I think besides your scientific knowledge, you set an incredible, steady example. And I thank you for that.  Dr. Fauci: Well, thank you, Sanjay. It's been great being with you today, but it's been a really, really great experience being your friend and colleague over the last couple of decades or more.  Dr. Gupta: That's Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease doctor.   As you heard him say, the best thing we can all do at the moment is hang in there.   We will get through this, and we'll get through this together.  We'll be back tomorrow. Thanks for listening.  "
Expelliarmus boredom! JK Rowling launches 'Harry Potter at Home' hub for kids in lockdown,"London (CNN)The Wizarding World just got bigger. ""Harry Potter"" author JK Rowling has launched an online Potter hub to keep children educated and entertained during the coronavirus pandemic. ""Harry Potter at Home"" brings together a number of resources related to the international franchise, including free access to the audiobook version of the first installment in the series. ""Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone"" has been added to Audible's library of free books as part of its partnership with the platform, making it immediately available in several different languages for free, and without requiring a subscription to the Amazon-owned audiobook service. Other features of the hub include articles, puzzles and videos, made available by publishers Bloomsbury and Scholastic. ""Parents, teachers and carers working to keep children amused and interested while we're on lockdown might need a bit of magic,"" Rowling said as she announced the launch. ""For over twenty years now, Hogwarts has been an escape for all -- for readers and fans, young and old,"" the website organizers added in a post introducing the platform.  ""During the strange times we now find ourselves in, we want to welcome you back to Hogwarts, where you will find a friendly retreat for you, your family and those you are caring for."" The coronavirus pandemic has closed schools and workplaces and confined hundreds of millions of people around the world to their homes, leading to a surge in internet use and increased interest in a number of online tools.  Rowling previously announced she was relaxing copyright permissions around the ""Harry Potter"" series, allowing teachers to post videos of themselves reading aloud from the books for their students.

Some English Premier League clubs living in 'moral vacuum' amid coronavirus pandemic," (CNN)With the English Premier League season on hiatus amid the coronavirus outbreak, some of its leading clubs are coming in for heavy criticism for using a UK government job program, with one British lawmaker accusing them of living in a ""moral vacuum.""Aleks Klosok contributed to this report Tottenham Hotspur, Newcastle United and Norwich City have chosen to use the government's 'Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme,' which will pay employees placed on temporary leave 80% of their wages -- up to a maximum of £2,500 a month. Bournemouth has also announced it will be using the scheme, though it would top up salaries of those affected by the furloughing, while some high ranking employees, including first-team manager Eddie Howe, have taken voluntary pay cuts. But with the 20 Premier League teams sharing billions of dollars from the current TV rights deal and players earning million-dollar salaries, Julian Knight, the chair of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport committee, says the idea of teams using the job scheme ""sticks in the throat."" With much of the UK shut down due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the job scheme was intended to help employers that had been severely affected by the coronavirus. READ: 'Deeply embarrassed' Jack Grealish apologizes for ignoring UK government lockdown advice READ: Football is shut down across Europe due to the coronavirus, but in Belarus it's business as usual ""This exposes the crazy economics in English football and the moral vacuum at its center,"" Knight told Telegraph Sport. ""This isn't what it's designed for. It's not designed to effectively allow them to continue to pay people (players) hundreds of thousands of pounds, while at the same time furloughing staff on hundreds of pounds. ""I don't know whether or not the Treasury can legally turn down these applications,"" added Knight, referring to the UK finance ministry. ""I think football needs to have a good, long, hard look at itself and see whether or not morally this is really right and whether or not actually what they need to do is come to an arrangement with some of their stars so they can continue to pay their [non-playing] staff 100% of their wages rather than furloughing them on 80%."" CNN has contacted the Premier League, Tottenham Hotspur, Newcastle United and Norwich City for comment. Knight added on Thursday that he would like to see the British chancellor impose a ""significant financial penalty"" on clubs to help reimburse those affected most. ""We are facing an obscene situation where top players who aren't working are continuing to see hundreds of thousands of pounds roll in each week while the staff who keep the clubs going are losing wages,"" he said. ""That's why I have written to Chancellor Rishi Sunak today demanding that Premier League clubs do the right thing by Tuesday next week or face the consequences."" 'Greatest burden' In contrast, Barcelona players have taken a 70% wage cut to ensure that all non-playing members of staff continue to get paid a full salary during the pandemic, while Juventus' first-team squad has given up 100% of its wages for four months to save the club $100 million. READ: Cristiano Ronaldo and Juventus squad give up $100 million in wages amid coronavirus outbreak READ: Lionel Messi and Barcelona squad to take 70% pay reduction during coronavirus pandemic The average salary for a Premier League footballer is £3 million per year -- or £61,000 per week. The Premier League, English Football League (EFL) and the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) were meeting on Wednesday to discuss a collective wage deferral agreement. Sadiq Khan, London's mayor, has called on Premier League players to ""carry the burden"" of coronavirus' impact on club finances. ""My view is always that those who are the least well-off should get the most help,"" he told BBC Radio 5 Live. ""Highly paid football players are people who can carry the greatest burden and they should be the first ones to, with respect, sacrifice their salary, rather than the person selling the program or the person who does catering, or the person who probably doesn't get anywhere near the salary some of the Premier League footballers get. ""It should be those with the broadest shoulders who go first because they can carry the greatest burden and have probably got savings, rather than those who work in catering or hospitality who have probably got no savings and live week by week and who probably won't get the [government] benefits for five weeks."" On the same day that Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy announced all non-playing staff would have their wages cut by 20% and, ""where appropriate,"" use the government's scheme, it was widely reported his salary had increased from £3 million to £7 million. This included a £3 million bonus for the completion of the club's new stadium, which was both late and over budget. In his announcement on the Spurs website, Levy also suggested Premier League first-team squads and managers should make sacrifices to help clubs through the current hiatus. ""We hope the current discussions between the Premier League, PFA and LMA will result in players and coaches doing their bit for the football ecosystem,"" he wrote. On Tuesday, Tottenham announced it had made the club stadium and facilities available to the NHS to assist in local Covid-19 relief efforts. The stadium's basement car park will be set up as a storage base and distribution hub for London Food Alliance, which helps get food supplies to people most vulnerable during the pandemic Earlier on Wednesday the Premier League and EFL said in a statement that ""there are no quick answers to how and when we will return to what used to be our football normality."" All professional football in England is currently suspended indefinitely until at least Thursday 30 April. "
Nunes again questions need for social distancing as experts warn coronavirus worst is yet to come,"Washington (CNN)California Rep. Devin Nunes on Tuesday complained that his state's decision to close schools is ""way overkill"" and unnecessarily harms the economy despite experts' urgent calls to maintain social distancing to save lives during the coronavirus pandemic. The comments by the Republican congressman, who has repeatedly questioned experts' guidance, were made hours after President Donald Trump warned Americans that the coronavirus death toll could exceed 100,000 nationwide and as more states are issuing stay-at-home orders in an effort to prevent further spreading. Last month, California Gov. Gavin Newsom said schools were likely to be closed for the rest of the school year.  ""The schools were just canceled out here in California, which is way overkill,"" Nunes said during an interview on Fox News. ""It's possible kids could have gone back to school in two weeks to four weeks, but they just canceled the rest of the schools.""  LISTEN: The Coronavirus: Fact vs. Fiction Podcast Nunes said he was ""optimistic"" about the use of anti-malaria drugs to treat coronavirus. The Food and Drug Administration has issued emergency use authorizations for two such drugs, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, to be used on patients hospitalized with coronavirus, assuming the drugs come from the national stockpile. Versions of the drugs -- which been used to safely prevent and treat malaria, lupus and other conditions -- could already be prescribed off-label, but the authorizations signaled that the FDA believed the benefits of the drugs could outweigh their risks. Still, there is little scientific evidence thus far proving that they're effective for treating coronavirus. ""The vaccines are going to take a while, but look, we have this bill that we just passed last week, $2.2 trillion' worth, we have to focus on keeping people employed,"" Nunes said. ""I will tell you this: If we don't start to get people back to work in this country over the next week to two weeks, I don't believe we can wait until the end of April."" He continued, ""I just don't know of any economy that's ever survived or you unplug the entire economy and expect things to go back and be normal. So the more tests that are out there, the more people getting testing, let's learn about the treatments. Let's get good data as to who is being impacted and let's figure out a way to get back to work."" The United States has struggled to get a complete picture of the scope of the problem since the early days of the outbreak because of testing problems. While progress has been made, some Americans, even some on the front lines, report an inability to get tested, and some are resorting to self-diagnositic tools. Earlier Tuesday, Trump warned of a ""painful"" two weeks to come during a White House briefing, and he has extended social distancing guidelines to April 30 after previous 15-day guidelines were set to expire. Nunes has previously disputed experts' guidance on limiting social contacts in order to stem the spread of coronavirus. Last month, the California Republican urged ""healthy"" Americans to visit bars and local restaurants during the pandemic, though many people who are infected don't immediately experience symptoms. ""If you're healthy, you and your family, it's a great time to go out and go to a local restaurant, likely you can get in easily,"" Nunes said during an interview on Fox News. ""Let's not hurt the working people in this country ... go to your local pub."" There are more than 186,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the United States and more than 6,900 in California. At least 150 people have died from coronavirus in the state.  "
'I think he gets it now': New York Mayor Bill de Blasio searches for his footing in coronavirus crisis," (CNN)New York City announced its first confirmed case of Covid-19, the infection caused by coronavirus, on March 1. That same day, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio and his health commissioner put out statements reassuring the city that its political and public health leadership was ""prepared"" for what came next.  They were not.  One month later, New York is the epicenter of the world's coronavirus crisis. By Wednesday morning, more than 75,000 people had been infected statewide. Nearly 1,600 have died. Hospitals and health care workers are being stretched to their breaking points. New York City's streets alternate between an unnerving silence and the cutting blare of emergency vehicles. The catastrophic spread of the virus, which has claimed young and old, the anonymous poor and civic heroes, has also put a national microscope on de Blasio, a two-term mayor whose estimable progressive record is often overshadowed by a long-running rivalry with Gov. Andrew Cuomo and a difficult relationship with the local press corps. While Cuomo has become a political star outside New York for the first time in his long career after his coronavirus press conferences -- which mix detailed statistics with a projection of personal empathy absent from White House's daily briefings -- became a television sensation, de Blasio's public-facing performance has been faced with a rougher appraisal. New York Magazine, last Thursday, published a scathing tick-tock of the mayor's halting response to the crisis. Its verdict: ""When New York Needed Him Most, Bill de Blasio Had His Worst Week As Mayor."" Two days later, Politico's New York bureau ran a similarly biting account, which painted the mayor as serially indecisive or, worse, unduly skeptical of expert warnings. ""It's easy to sit on the sidelines and have an opinion,"" de Blasio press secretary Freddi Goldstein said in a statement. ""The mayor carries the responsibility of 8.6 million New Yorkers. He must think about their safety, their livelihood, their education. Every decision he has made has been deliberate and thoughtful. That's what you need in a crisis."" Former top de Blasio aides interviewed for this story both acknowledged the mayor's errors and bristled at what they described as a media narrative that ignored Cuomo's own initial hesitance to act. Both leaders wrestled with questions over shelter-in-place orders and the decision, after days of uncertainty, to close city schools. On most major policy issues, they argued, de Blasio and Cuomo have pulled -- eventually -- in the same direction. Mixed messages But de Blasio, in his defiant style, dug himself a deeper hole. His early declarations, before the first cases turned up, urging New Yorkers to go about their business, were followed by a bizarre stretch capped off by a visit to his gym on March 16, the first day of school closures -- as the city settled in anxiously for a coming storm. Only two days earlier, de Blasio had pushed back against increasingly desperate calls to shut down high-density gathering locations. ""I am not ready today at this hour to say, let's have a city with no bars, no restaurants, no rec centers, no libraries,"" he said on March 14. ""I'm not there."" Many New Yorkers agreed with him. On that mild Saturday night, they flocked to crowded bars and restaurants. Others watched them, from afar on social media, with horror. By Sunday night, de Blasio reversed course and announced that many of the same locations that hosted revelers the night before would be closed or limited to take-out service in the coming days. The following Tuesday, de Blasio went a step further, saying New Yorkers should be prepared for a ""shelter-in-place"" order. Cuomo quickly rejected the prospect -- before initiating a similar policy just a few days later. Still, the mayor's early moves to downplay the threat undermined his credibility with an increasingly jittery public. During an appearance this past Sunday on CNN's ""State of the Union,"" de Blasio was confronted with some of his earlier appeals for calm and normalcy, and asked by host Jake Tapper if his message was, in part, to blame for the virus's rapid spread in New York. De Blasio, who had been critical of the White House's response, demurred when asked if he should face the same scrutiny. ""We should not be focusing, in my view, on anything looking back on any level of government right now.  This is just about how we save lives going forward,"" the mayor said. ""We all were working, everybody was working with the information we had, and trying, of course, to avoid panic, and at that point, for all of us, trying to keep -- not only protect lives, but keep the economy and the livelihoods together, keep ensuring that people had money to pay for food and medicine. I mean, this was a very different world just a short time ago."" His invocations of ""a very different world"" have roiled some New Yorkers, who point to the very similar scenarios that played out in China and Italy before the crisis reached American shores -- and its largest city. Cuomo conceded in his press conference on Tuesday that the state has been consistently on its heels.  ""It was coming here,"" he said. ""We have been behind it from Day One since it got here. And we've been playing catch-up. You don't win playing catch-up. We have to get ahead of it."" A tonal shift  Amid the criticism, and the mounting death toll, de Blasio's tone has changed. Taking his own advice, he has mostly set aside any criticism of President Donald Trump. His own press briefings are, much like Cuomo's, steeped in worst-case projections and increasingly sharp demands that New Yorkers adhere to stay-at-home and social distancing standards.  When the USNS Comfort arrived in New York Harbor on Monday morning, de Blasio offered a weighty welcome. ""There have been times in recent days when a lot of New Yorkers have felt alone. When a lot of New Yorkers have felt a sense of not being sure what's coming next. Not being sure if help would come,"" he said. ""Well, I want to say to all New Yorkers, we have evidence here that you are not alone. We are not alone. Our nation is helping us in our hour of need."" The mayor's shift to a full embrace of stricter tactics designed to ""flatten the curve"" -- and away from his personal inclinations, like closing schools only as a last resort -- coincided with the New Yorkers' own panicked turn.   ""I think when the public health implications and projections started to firm up last week, on just how grave this was going to be, you saw a mayor become much more decisive and much less deliberative,"" former de Blasio spokesman Eric Phillips said. ""And that isn't his natural posture. He is a deliberator. For better or for worse, he starts from a place of deliberation. And that often serves him well."" Rebecca Katz, a former top adviser to de Blasio, traced the change to around the time of his gym visit two weeks ago, as the scale of the crisis -- and dire forecasts of what was to come -- became impossible to ignore. She attributed de Blasio's sometimes tortured rhetoric in the run-up, including a riff in which he encouraged New Yorkers to visit their favorite locals bars on the night before they would be shuttered, to an instinct that has, under difference circumstances, served him well. ""He's a New Yorker who cherishes New York things. And I think just like a million New Yorkers were grieving the loss of life as normal, he was, too. Except that as the leader, you have to be the one to give it up first. That's where it got tricky,"" Katz said. ""I think he gets it now."" New York moves fast and there have been, over the last few days, green shoots of optimism have opened up amid the misery. Officials say number of new cases, though mounting in number, is slowing its rate. Federal aid is making itself seen, as new hospitals, one floating and another growing inside the cavernous Javits Center come online and prepare to see patients. But there are still questions to answer -- the kind that might have tempted de Blasio into a gaffe a couple weeks ago. On Tuesday, a reporter asked de Blasio at a press conference at the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Queens, where an emergency hospital is being stood up, about the prospects of the U.S. Open, the Grand Slam tournament that typically arrives in the borough late each summer. ""August may be a very much better time, or we might still be fighting some of these battles,"" de Blasio said, staying on message. ""We don't know yet."" "
1.1 million autoworkers are off the job in Europe,"London (CNN Business)More than 1.1 million autoworkers have been forced to stay home in Europe as the coronavirus pandemic closes plants and brings production in the region to a standstill.  The European Automobile Manufacturers' Association said that factory closures have so far affected roughly 40% of workers directly employed in vehicle manufacturing in Europe. The work stoppage has already reduced regional production by 1.2 million units, it added.  ""Right now, the primary concern ... is to manage the immediate crisis facing the auto industry, which has essentially come to an abrupt halt — something the sector has never experienced before,"" said Eric-Mark Huitema, director general of the association.  Carmakers including Volkswagen (VLKAF), BMW (BMWYY), Daimler (DDAIF), Honda (HMC), Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) and Peugeot owner PSA Group (PUGOY) have closed factories as Italy, France, Germany and the United Kingdom impose restrictions on work and public life in order to prevent the virus from spreading.  The automotive sector, which has already endured more than two years of a sales recession, now faces its biggest crisis since the 2008 global financial crisis, according to GlobalData, an analytics company. ""Supply chains are affected and workforces are affected. It is challenging to manufacture vehicles and components without endangering a workforce,"" said Calum MacRae, an analyst at GlobalData. The European industry association said that nearly 14 million jobs in Europe depend on automaking. And 83% of European automotive suppliers are concerned about supply chain disruption because of the pandemic, according to research firm IHS Markit.  Continental (CTTAF), a major supplier based in Germany, withdrew its 2020 financial outlook on Wednesday after ongoing uncertainty forced it to temporarily close 40% of its 249 production locations worldwide. In Germany alone, 30,000 of the company's employees have registered for short-time work, a program that enables companies to send their workers home or reduce their hours without laying them off.  ""In periods of crisis, financial liquidity is of top priority,"" CEO Elmar Degenhart said in a statement. ""To this end, we are cutting our costs, optimizing our working capital and postponing projects and investments that are not urgently required until further notice."" Companies take action Volkswagen, the world's largest car manufacturer, has shuttered factories in Europe including its plant in Wolfsburg, Germany, one of the biggest manufacturing sites in the world. Fiat Chrysler has also shut down its factories across Europe, but there have been no permanent layoffs made by the group yet, according to a spokesperson. ""As the pandemic has spread, we have prioritized creating a safe and healthy workplace but also worked to safeguard the jobs of permanent FCA employees,"" CEO Mike Manley wrote in a letter to employees on March 30. FCA employees in Italy are taking temporary leave, with their pay subsidized by the government.  Mercedes owner Daimler (DDAIF) said in a statement that it would apply for short-time work for many production and selected administrative staff in Germany from April 6 through at least April 17. Honda employs 3,000 people at its factory in Swindon, in the United Kingdom, where production has been suspended until April 14 in accordance with government guidance. Workers who are not required to attend work will continue to receive pay. Other carmakers have taken similar steps in Europe.  "

The ethical minefield of prioritizing health care for some with Covid-19,"Ira Bedzow, Ph.D., is an associate professor of medicine in the School of Medicine, the director of the Biomedical Ethics and Humanities Program, and head of the UNESCO Chair in Bioethics at New York Medical College.  Lila Kagedan is a clinical ethicist and the assistant director of the Biomedical Ethics and Humanities Program at New York Medical College. The views expressed in this commentary are their own. View more opinion articles on CNN. (CNN)""We are at war with a virus that threatens to tear us apart,"" the World Health Organization Director-General, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, told world leaders in a virtual summit on the coronavirus pandemic Thursday. Join us on Twitter and Facebook Such dramatic phrasing as ""the war against Covid-19"" and ""physicians are on the front lines of battle"" is heard everywhere today -- in the media, and from politicians and health care workers around the globe.  As US hospitals grapple with the influx of infected patients, this war analogy is creating a morally problematic way of thinking about how to allocate resources to the critically ill. In a war, we want to treat and return the strongest and fiercest soldiers to the battlefield to kill the enemy. In a pandemic that is straining medical resources and health care systems, we want something different: to save civilians' lives in a way that maintains our own humanity. Ethicists use the term ""triage"" to explain how on-the-ground decisions about health care are decided in a medical emergency.  While ""triage"" has become an accepted medical term, its roots in wartime practice has the potential to influence who should get treatment for Covid-19 based on factors that are not strictly clinical.   This influence does not apply when there are resources -- even if limited -- to be had, but rather when critical capacity is overwhelmed and decisions must be made about how to treat too many people with too few resources.   We do not fight a disease in the same way that we fight an enemy during wartime.  We should therefore be making decisions based on concerns that are clinically relevant to survival. And we should not be making utilitarian decisions that make assumptions about who would remain, and compose the best society, after the pandemic is over.    Hospital ethics committees around the country are looking for guidance to a few recent policy models, advanced in medical journals and in public discussions, regarding the allocation of resources during the pandemic.  However, many of these example policies rely on two dubious assumptions.   First, they make a distinction between public health ethics and clinical ethics and frame these decisions in terms of public health. This distinction is meant to focus on the welfare of the general population rather than those individual patients toward whom physicians have a fiduciary responsibility. This then justifies making decisions based on ""the greatest good for the greatest number"" even if certain individuals may suffer from it.   The mistake of this type of thinking is that it frames these triage decisions incorrectly: as matters of public health. Medical professionals in the hospital serve a clinical role and should be making clinical decisions.  Public health policies are about prevention of disease and utilize overarching community strategies such as ""shelter at home."" They are not meant to deal with individual treatment decisions -- even if there are many -- that need to be made in the moment.   Moreover, even if one were to apply public health ethics here, the fundamental values of clinical ethics would still apply -- just on a larger scale. As such, we cannot simply throw out values, such as equity and social justice, because they are harder to maintain in a triage environment.  Second, not only are these ethicists' example policies for resource allocation utilitarian in the sense of saving the most lives, they would also create policies that prioritize saving the most ""life-years."" Saving the most ""life-years"" does not mean that those with the highest chance of survival from Covid-19 would get treated first.   It means that, between two people with somewhat equal chances of survival, those perceived to have the most years left to live would get greater consideration. The moral justification for this prioritization is that it gives younger people the opportunity to live through life stages that they have yet to reach.   While some ethicists try to explain that this choice does not consider intrinsic worth or social utility, it is very hard not to see this as a way of saying ""Well, older people, you have had a good run. Let's let the younger people have a chance to get old now as well.""   There are other ways to respond to the challenge of choosing between cases of equal mortality, such as ""first come, first served"" or lottery selection. Of course, in the case of Covid-19, age is often clinically relevant, since with age comes other physiological factors or conditions that will affect chances for survival. But we should be fully aware of when we are considering a clinical factor and when we are submitting a patient to social bias.  We understand the motivation to be utilitarian and to want to maximize ""life-years"" -- it makes the rules clear and it is easy to feel that ""life is good, so more life is better."" But clarity alone does not make for good morality.   Prioritizing ""life-years"" solely for the sake of giving the youth a chance to get old is as much a non-clinical social decision as any other that we should try to avoid.   Potential quantity should not be deemed actual. We may assume a younger person will live longer, but one can never be sure that this will be so.  We should not be utilitarian based on assumptions that are outside the clinically relevant. Ethics committees and medical professionals have no moral authority to presume the value of ""life-years"" or who will give a greater contribution to society when the pandemic is over.   Guidelines for ethical allocation of resources should stick to considerations of chances for overall survival from Covid-19. Indirect factors, such as age, disability, and comorbidity (existing physiological conditions that make a patient more vulnerable), should only be considered as they relate to prognosis and survivability.   It will seldom if ever be the case that all considerations for resource allocation for two Covid-19 patients will be exactly equal. And if there is a case where it is close, we shouldn't simply defer to general guidelines that turn decision makers into soldiers on the front lines.   "
"Ruth Bader Ginsburg continues to work out at Supreme Court private gym, her trainer says","Washington (CNN)Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is continuing her workouts at the Supreme Court gym amid the coronavirus pandemic, according to her longtime personal trainer.CNN's Ariane De Vogue and Joan Biskupic contributed to this report. Bryant Johnson, Ginsburg's trainer, told the news outlet Law360 on Tuesday that Ginsburg, 87 and a four-time cancer survivor, does not want to stop her sessions.  ""Everybody's been shut down. The only reason why I didn't shut the justice down is because, hey, she ain't having it,"" Johnson said. Washington, DC has implemented a stay-at-home order and closed all public gyms due to the pandemic. Supreme Court spokeswoman Kathy Arberg said Ginsburg has her own exercise spot. ""At Justice Ginsburg's request, the Court has set aside the limited private space next to its health facility for Justice Ginsburg to exercise. Her doctors share her view that the training sessions are essential to her well-being,"" Arberg told CNN. ""The space is being used exclusively by the justice,"" Arberg added. ""No other justices are using the space, and the employee gym is closed to all users."" Johnson has not returned CNN's requests for comment.  Johnson told Law360 that he has canceled his appointments with other clients and has only been working with Ginsburg. The court building has been closed to the public but staffers continue to visit the offices for official business. Johnson said he is taking extra precautions and keeping a safe distance between him and Ginsburg during their sessions.  He said he wipes ""every piece of equipment"" he thinks Ginsburg will come in contact with and washes his hands after.  ""Her choice is, she doesn't make excuses not to do it,"" Johnson told Law360. ""So we find ways to do it."" Johnson, an Army reservist, has been working with the liberal legal icon since 1999 after she underwent surgery for colorectal cancer.  Ginsburg has had a lengthy history of medical issues, but has always quickly returned to her workout regimen. In January, she told CNN that she was ""cancer-free."" The city's ""stay-at-home order"" from April 1 through April 24 says all residents should remain in their homes except for ""essential activities,"" like buying groceries.  Residents can also ""engage in allowable recreational activities"" outdoors with household members, such as walking, hiking, dog-walking, biking and other activities where there is no person-to-person contact.  DC requirements for social distancing, as recommended by health experts, is to maintain 6 feet of distance from other individuals. The court indefinitely postponed a slate of 11 cases that were to be heard in March -- but has yet to announce alternatives for regular oral arguments scheduled for April. The justices have been working from home and conducting internal meetings by telephone, and the court expanded remote working capabilities to reduce the number of employees in the building. Decisions are being issued online, rather than in the courtroom.  Ginsburg and a majority of her colleagues on the high court qualify as ""older adults"" at higher risk of getting sick from Covid-19, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""She has that grandfather status to me and if she wants to train, that's the least that I can do,"" Johnson said. UPDATE: This story has been update with comment from the Supreme Court. "

Why Donald Trump shouldn't get credit for (finally) realizing coronavirus is actually deadly serious," (CNN)On Tuesday, President Donald Trump seemed to get it.   THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! In each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! He stood in front of his coronavirus task force and, in somber terms, told the public that the next two weeks would see more illness and more death. He acknowledged that the death toll, if America keeps to its current social distancing guidelines, will likely fall somewhere between 100,000 and 240,000 dead Americans. ""Our country is in the midst of a great national trial unlike any it has ever faced before,"" Trump said. Which, well, it's about time. The truth here is that everything Trump said on Tuesday about the spread and dangers -- and even the number of dead -- has been known publicly for weeks. The only leader who failed to acknowledge it was, well, the President. Consider that 23 days ago, Trump sent out this tweet to his 70+ million followers: ""So last year 37,000 Americans died from the common Flu. It averages between 27,000 and 70,000 per year. Nothing is shut down, life & the economy go on. At this moment there are 546 confirmed cases of CoronaVirus, with 22 deaths. Think about that!"" Even when he sent that tweet, scientists and infectious disease experts were telling anyone who would listen that this was NOT the flu -- its mortality rate was far higher, we had no herd immunity to it and there was no vaccine. Trump didn't want to believe that. So he decided it was wrong. And through his words and actions -- whether his tweets and public statements downplaying the threat or his administration's too-slow reaction to the lack of adequate testing -- Trump's decisions helped get us to this bad place. Now, to be clear: This is not to lay blame for the coronavirus at Trump's feet. This was -- and is -- a virus that had never before been transmitted to humans. There is no vaccine. Governments around the world are struggling with combating it and protecting their citizens even as I write. But there is NO question that Trump's downplaying of the virus in these critical last few weeks has played a role in the fact that we are now faced with the blunt reality of significantly more deaths of Americans from coronavirus than died in the Vietnam War (58,220). ""There's no question the United States missed the opportunity to get ahead of the novel coronavirus,"" Bill Gates wrote in an op-ed for The Washington Post on Wednesday.  The Boston Globe editorial board was even more blunt, writing in an editorial headlined ""A president unfit for a pandemic:"" ""While the spread of the novel coronavirus has been aggressive around the world, much of the profound impact it will have here in the United States was preventable. As the American public braces itself for the worst of this crisis, it's worth remembering that the reach of the virus here is not attributable to an act of God or a foreign invasion, but a colossal failure of leadership. ""The outbreak that began in China demanded a White House that could act swiftly and competently to protect public health, informed by science and guided by compassion and public service. It required an administration that could quickly deploy reliable tests around the nation to isolate cases and trace and contain the virus's spread, as South Korea effectively did, as well as to manufacture and distribute scarce medical supplies around the country. It begged for a president of the United States to deliver clear, consistent, scientifically sound messages on the state of the epidemic and its solutions, to reassure the public amid their fear, and to provide steady guidance to cities and states. And it demanded a leader who would put the country's well-being first, above near-term stock market returns and his own reelection prospects, and who would work with other nations to stem the tide of COVID-19 cases around the world."" Trump is in the process of doing what he always does: Rewriting history -- and, specifically, his own actions to ensure that he is the hero of the story. Over the past 48 hours, he has repeatedly cited estimates that without any interventions -- like social distancing -- more than 2 million Americans could lose their lives as a result of the coronavirus. Which, sure. But there was never ANY question as to whether the US needed to follow best practices on how to flatten the curve on the spread of the coronavirus. Especially given that Trump -- and the rest of the country -- saw how coronavirus had affected China and led to an effective shuttering of society to stop its spread. What Trump is doing is the equivalent of taking out your parents' brand-new car, getting in an accident because you were looking at your phone while driving and then telling them that they are lucky that the smashed-up front end is the only damage because it would have been worse without your amazing driving skills. Your parents wouldn't buy that. They'd want you to not have been looking at your phone and for their new car not to be damaged. Again, I am not saying that Trump and his administration could have prevented all deaths in America from the coronavirus. Because of the openness of our society and the infection/mortality rate of this virus, that would have been totally impossible. But what I am suggesting is that Trump doesn't deserve plaudits for finally realizing and acknowledging the severity of this crisis when there are already 3,000+ Americans dead and even the rosiest projections suggest tens of thousands more will die. Keep in mind that South Korea and the United States both got their first cases on the same day: January 20. The two countries took very different approaches in responding to the virus. South Korea has so far reported 165 deaths from the coronavirus and successfully flattened its curve due to aggressive testing and isolation practices. There were ways in the US -- stocking up earlier on needed medical equipment like masks and ventilators, widespread availability of testing, a federal shelter-in-place edict -- in which the catastrophic loss of life we are now facing could have been mitigated. Trump didn't do those things and, worse, he publicly dismissed concerns about the virus, sending a signal to many Americans that they should go on with their daily lives. (Trump isn't the only politician guilty of this; New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio did the same earlier this month.) Those decisions inarguably made things worse. And played a major role where we are today -- hoping that only 100,000 of our fellow Americans die from coronavirus. "
Joe Biden casts doubt on Democratic convention happening as planned," (CNN)Joe Biden on Tuesday said it is difficult to imagine the Democratic National Convention, scheduled for July, taking place as planned amid the coronavirus pandemic.  Asked during an interview on MSNBC if he can see Democrats from all over the country congregating inside a hot arena just 104 days from now, Biden replied, ""It's hard to envision that,"" adding, ""again, we should listen to the scientists."" He noted that one reason the Democratic convention was scheduled to be held at an earlier date -- July 13 through 16 -- was so it would occur before the summer Olympics, which have since been postponed.  Visit CNN's Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race ""We ought to be able to do, we were able to do in the middle of a Civil War all the way through to World War II, have Democratic and Republican conventions and primaries and elections and still have public safety. And we're able to do both. But the fact is it may have to be different,"" he said. CNN previously reported that Democrats are considering a range of contingency plans for the convention to be held in July, including shortening the in-person portion or going entirely digital.  The head of the Democratic National Convention Committee responded to Biden's suggestion, saying they will ""balance protecting the health and well-being of convention attendees and our host city with our responsibility to deliver this historic and critical occasion."" ""Providing an opportunity for our candidate to reaffirm our democratic values, unify the party and share his vision for a safer and stronger future for our country has never before felt more important,"" Democratic National Convention Committee CEO Joe Solmonese said in a statement.  A convention aide tells CNN that they believe ""Biden's full remarks are in line with the convention's contingency planning efforts that center on following the guidance of health officials and prioritizing the health and safety of all attendees and our host community."" Biden said he believed that an election would still happen in November, but added that people would likely have to vote differently, suggesting mail-in ballots or even ""drive-in"" voting. Regardless, Biden said, ""there's been no rationale for eliminating or delaying the election. It may be virtual."" In his interview, Biden also said that Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer is on his shortlist for a potential running mate -- and that she had been on the list before her public spat with President Donald Trump. There are about six to 10 women on that shortlist, Biden said. Asked if any individuals, including Whitmer in particular, have lengthened his list as a result of the spotlight they have received from handling of coronavirus, Biden replied, ""She didn't lengthen the list. She made the list in my mind two months ago."" He said that whether or not Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is still in the race, his campaign will assemble an organization to run background checks, beginning the vetting process for his running mate by mid-April. This story has been updated to include comments from the Democratic National Convention Committee. "
Members of a children's choir test positive for coronavirus after UK tour,"Kampala (CNN)Members of Uganda's internationally known Watoto Church children's choir who just returned from Europe are among 11 new reported cases of coronavirus in the country, President Yoweri Museveni has said. Their cluster brings the nation's total to 44 confirmed cases, Minister of Health Dr. Jane Ruth Aceng said. Some members of the singing group were already under government quarantine following their return in mid-March from the United Kingdom, Museveni said in a televised address on Tuesday. Two groups from the famous children's choir returned two weeks ago from tours of the United Kingdom and Canada, Watoto Church said Wednesday in a statement.  Most of the new positive cases were detected in travelers who returned from the United Kingdom, according to the nation's Health Ministry. No one who'd been to Canada has shown symptoms of the virus, church leaders said. Both teams, including adult chaperones, were quarantined separately upon returning to Uganda, and some in the UK group were isolated after they began showing ""mild symptoms."" The church did not say how many were symptomatic or give details of those cases. Precautions have been taken to keep others safe at facilities run by the church, which helps vulnerable children and families, its leaders said.  Authorities in the East African nation have imposed a two-week lockdown among a wide range of measures to contain the spread of the virus. Schools have been closed, and all social activities in the nation have come to a halt. Museveni announced additional movement restrictions Monday, including a total ban on all vehicular movement except for essential services. The President said it was better to take strong precautionary measures to contain the spread of the virus. ""If we use a hammer to kill a fly (taking too strong measures to deal with a small problem), it will be better than being complacent only to find out later that too many Ugandans are infected and they're dying as is happening in other countries,"" Museveni said in a tweet. "
White House task force could soon recommend Americans wear masks," (CNN)Most members of President Donald Trump's coronavirus task force have come to agree that Americans should begin wearing face coverings in public and could issue formal guidance on the matter soon, people familiar with the matter said. CNN's Betsy Klein contributed to this report. Trump signaled he was open to the idea during Tuesday's White House briefing and members of the task force are working to draft recommendations on how to fashion the coverings to prevent spread of the virus.  ""My feeling is, if people want to do it, there's certainly no harm to it. I would say do it,"" Trump said Tuesday. ""But use a scarf if you want, you know? Rather than going out and getting a mask or whatever."" His comments reflect a growing belief by administration officials that more needs to be done to prevent the spread of the virus by infected people who aren't displaying symptoms. A fabric covering of the nose and mouth could prevent the virus from reaching other people, health experts believe. Previously, some members of the task force -- including Dr. Deborah Birx -- cautioned in meetings against recommending Americans wear masks because of a fear it could lull them into a false sense of protection and prevent them from socially distancing. But new insights into asymptomatic spread of the virus have led to a reconsideration of the guidance.  ""Now we've learned about this disease -- and we've always said we're going to learn more, we're going to adjust -- and we've learned there's a fair amount of asymptomatic spread and so we've asked the CDC to take another look at whether or not having more people wear masks will prevent transmission of the disease to other people,"" US Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams said Wednesday on ABC ""Good Morning America."" Among the issues discussed by the task force and the Centers for Disease Control Prevention have been how to teach Americans to wear masks and how to prevent a rush on medical-grade equipment, like N95 respirators, still in short supply for hospitals.  There have also been discussions of the cultural shift that recommending masks would represent, since Americans (unlike citizens of some Asian countries) are not accustomed to wearing masks in public.  And there has been some consideration of whether or not to call the recommended face coverings ""masks."" Some have suggested referring to them simply as ""face coverings"" or ""courtesy masks"" to distinguish them from the medical masks needed by professionals. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease specialist, said he would ""lean toward"" recommending that the general public wear facemasks ""if we do not have the problem of taking away masks from the health care workers who need them."" During a taping for Wednesday's ""Coronavirus: Fact vs. Fiction"" podcast, Fauci told CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta that facemasks would be a ""subject of conversation"" at the White House. ""Particularly now that we're getting some inklings that there's transmission of infection from an asymptomatic person who is not coughing, who is not sneezing, who just appears well. Well, then how do you think that's happening?"" Fauci said. ""It very well could be aerosol. Maybe not aerosol, you know, that goes on for hours. But even the slight aerosol in which you're talking to somebody. If that's the case, we should at least look at the data and try to make a decision about that."" Despite a lack of conclusive evidence that masks prevent transmission of respiratory diseases, some experts have argued that non-medical fabric masks might make a dent in transmission risk.  Throughout the pandemic thus far, the World Health Organization and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have advised against the general public's use of masks unless they are already sick. ""Something doesn't have to be 100% effective to be beneficial,"" Fauci said. Kellyanne Conway, who serves as White House counselor, reiterated Wednesday that the possibility of CDC guidelines shifting to recommend Americans wear masks is ""still hypothetical"" but ""under active consideration."" She added: ""Please be respectful of the fact that we need to surge those supplies for our health care workers and first responders."" "
"In Panama, coronavirus lockdown means separating men and women"," (CNN)Panama is taking a new -- if somewhat unorthodox — measure to combat the spread of the novel coronavirus: separation of the sexes.   Starting on Wednesday, only women will be able to leave their homes to buy necessities on Monday, Wednesday and Friday.   Men in Panama will be allowed to venture outside to run errands on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday.   Everyone will have to stay home on Sundays. The restrictions will last for at least 15 days, according to government officials.   The additional measures to the already-announced national quarantine in theory will make it easier for police in the Central American nation to limit the number of people going out in public.   ""The great quantity of people circulating outside their homes, despite the obligatory national quarantine, has led the national government to take more severe measures,"" said a statement by Panamanian President Laurentino ""Nito"" Cortizo on Twitter.   Earlier, Panamanian officials had ordered all citizens to stay inside except for emergencies and to buy food. But alarmed by the number of people still going out, Panamanian officials decided to divide the week by sex to further limit how much of the public is outside their homes at one time.   Even on their designated days both men and women will only have two hours to do their shopping, according to the Panamanian government release.   Panama has 1075 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 27 deaths, according to health officials, and has already taken some of the toughest measures in the region to stop the spread of the illness.   The country has banned all domestic and international travel. It has shut down airports and -- after a March 22 deadline -- prevented even Panamanian citizens from traveling to the country.   A nightly curfew had already kept Panamanians from leaving their homes between 9pm and 5am each day. Under the new, more stringent measures, the curfew will now begin at 5pm. "
Nobel prize-winning economist: The relief package turned out better than I thought it would,"Joseph E. Stiglitz is an American economist and a professor at Columbia University. A recipient of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, he is a former senior vice president and chief economist of the World Bank and a former member and chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers during the Clinton administration. His latest book People, Power, and Profits: Progressive Capitalism for an Age of Discontent, is coming out in paperback this month. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. The federal bill just passed was an impressive response to the economic consequences of the  coronavirus pandemic. But we should not refer to it as a  ""stimulus"" package. That's a misnomer:  It's not like 2008, when the economy faced insufficient demand because of problems in the financial sector. Then, a stimulus was what was required. Here, the problem is not lack of demand, but an implosion of the economy because of COVID-19.  The best way to keep powerful companies in check Where Trump went wrong in the US-China trade warThe US-China trade war hurts American families The first priority is to ensure that we have the right economics to protect our health — that's why assistance to hospitals and paid sick leave is so important. But beyond that we need to protect our citizens to prevent the extremes of deprivation and stress that would otherwise arise, and to put our economy on a sound footing for recovery once the pandemic is under control.  What the US economy needs is for the money to get into the right hands quickly and to keep workers linked to their employers.  In that respect, the bill rightly sought to strengthen the US unemployment insurance system, which is among the weakest in the advanced countries both in terms of coverage (the fraction of workers entitled to benefits) and replacement rates (benefits as a ratio of normal pay). If forecasts are correct, the burden on the unemployment insurance system will be enormous. The 3.3 million workers who registered for unemployment benefits last week increased the number of unemployed Americans by some 50% from the 5.8 million US workers  unemployed in February. And that latest number is likely low because some couldn't get through to the unemployment offices to register. Coverage for freelance workers and those in the gig economy is also an important part of the deal that will help make sure these people get much-needed support — but it will lead to unemployment benefit numbers increasing still further. Extending the period of coverage for unemployed workers and increasing payments will also be key provisions protecting the estimated 20% to 30% of the labor force that is likely to be unemployed.   The package also attempts to prevent people from falling through the cracks by providing $1,200 to individuals earning $75,000 or less or $2,400 to couples earning less than $150,000, although it does not go far enough to ensure financial stability for most Americans.  It was a fantasy for the Trump administration to suggest it could send the checks out in two weeks. It took two weeks to get legislation passed, and now the administration says it will take another three weeks for those funds to reach taxpayers for whom the IRS has the requisite data. It will take even longer for the rest. With so many Americans living paycheck-to-paycheck, unable to cover a $400 emergency, this delay could be calamitous.   There is an urgency here: If families can't pay the landlords, and the landlords can't pay their bills, and so forth down the line, we could get a gridlocked economy that would be hard to start up in the future. I've seen this in other crises, and we don't want it here.     Given these problems, it was important that the legislation included provisions that many other countries have introduced — things like protection against eviction and foreclosure on homes with federal mortgages and a stay on interest payments on federal student debt.  But the legislation didn't go far enough: It should have included a stay on all evictions and mortgage foreclosures, credit cards and car repossessions. The stay for credit cards is especially important, given the high interest rates charged by credit card companies. Without it, many families will find themselves with unmanageable debt.   In addition to helping individuals, we must also sustain the economy and its financial system. Normal monetary and fiscal policy, while helpful, won't suffice because both supply and demand have been deeply perturbed. In 2008, monetary policy may have prevented the collapse of the banking system, but it didn't lead to a quick resuscitation of the economy.  So too here.   In 2008, the credit crunch came from the top down, from the bad behavior of the banks. Here it will come from the bottom up, because when people's income sources dry up, they won't be able to pay their bills, with cascading effects throughout the economy.  For this, we need more of a bottom-up response than in 2008.  The $1,200 checks will be vital. Small businesses will also need the variety of benefits that are included in the legislation, including deferrals on certain tax payments and SBA loan repayments, grants and low-interest loans.   Then there are the bailouts. Giving money to companies that squandered the opportunity to put money aside for a rainy day because they opted for massive share buybacks is not the way.  That's old-fashioned trickle-down economics, which has never worked.  We need to distinguish between bailing out companies and bailing out their shareholders and bondholders. I have argued that loans should take the form of convertible bonds with warrants, so taxpayers get adequate compensation for the risk they bear, and the interest should be linked to their past behavior — if they've put themselves in this position by share buybacks and if they've been a tax avoider.  And there should be conditions on this money based on employment, governance, the treatment of labor and the environment.   The Democrats succeeded in putting in restrictions on the behavior most likely to outrage citizens: taxpayer money being used to pay executives' exorbitant salaries or to buy back shares.  They have also prevented companies from taking the money and laying off workers. What is most lacking in the package is an adequate sense of prioritization. We've forgotten the first lesson of economics:  Because resources are scarce, we need to prioritize. Should we be rescuing luxury hotels when our states may not be able to maintain essential services? When our universities, hard hit by losses of endowments and threatened by declining enrollments from foreign students, may have to cut back, including in grants they give to poor students? Just because a sector is able and willing to pay for more lobbyists or make larger campaign contributions does not mean it is more deserving of assistance. While this is not perfect legislation, it's far better than I had thought it would be. Many of the measures originally proposed by the administration, like a payroll tax cut, wouldn't have done the trick.  That measure wouldn't have delivered money to where it's needed the most.  Little would have trickled down to the workers, and workers who have lost their jobs would have gotten nothing.  Even worse  it would have been another corporate profit tax cut. The 2017 cut didn't generate investment and didn't raise wages; it primarily led to almost a trillion dollars of share buybacks.   These measures won't save all the restaurants and other small businesses that are closed as part of the steps taken to slow the spread of the coronavirus; but, if we can mobilize quickly, it will save the millions of Americans who will have no sources of income from economic ruin,  it can stave off the bottom-up financial crisis that is likely to arise otherwise, and it will put us in a far better position for recovery once the pandemic has been conquered.   Extraordinary times require extraordinary measures, and these are extraordinary times. "
US furloughs thousands of South Koreans who work on US bases over cost sharing dispute,"Washington (CNN)Thousands of South Koreans who work on US bases in South Korea were furloughed on Wednesday after the Trump administration and South Korea failed to reach a new cost-sharing formula for the cost of US troops stationed. CNN's Barbara Starr, Sophie Jeong and Chandelis Duster contributed to this report. CNN previously reported that top officials warned in February the move could undermine the US military mission amid tensions with North Korea. Approximately 4,500 South Korean workers are furloughed from their jobs on various US military installations on Tuesday. The dispute over the cost of the 28,500 US troops stationed on the Korean peninsula erupted after President Donald Trump asked for a 400% increase in South Korea's contribution under the so-called Special Measures Agreement. The demand outraged Seoul and concerned US lawmakers in both parties. In February, a senior State Department official said US officials had ""adjusted our stance"" during the course of negotiations, and said they are not currently laser-focused on getting the South Koreans to increase the amount they pay by 400%.   The last deal agreed upon in February 2019 boosted South Korea's contribution from about $800 million to nearly $1 billion. The commander of US troops in South Korea called the South Korean employees who were furloughed ""vital"" to the US mission and to the Republic of Korea-US alliance. ""While this is an unfortunate situation and we will miss them dearly, we will work to minimize the impact on our 'fight tonight' posture despite the strenuous circumstances,"" Gen. Robert Abrams said in a statement Wednesday. ""This is an unfortunate day for us...it's unthinkable...it's heartbreaking. The partial furlough of KN employees is not what we envisioned or hoped what would happen.""  The furloughs also come amid the global coronavirus pandemic. On Tuesday, South Korea's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 101 new cases of coronavirus, bringing the national total to 9,887 confirmed cases and 165 deaths. "
Airlines will offer fewer choices and higher fares after the coronavirus crisis,"New York (CNN Business)The US airline industry is about to get smaller. That's bad news for airline employees -- and for airline passengers. Airline traffic has plunged and it probably won't recover any time soon. The $50 billion aviation bailout passed last week will keep airlines in business and employees on the job for the the next six months. Still, airline executives suggested they expect fewer flights and slumping demand for air travel for quite some time. ""If the recovery is as slow as we fear, it means our airline and our workforce will have to be smaller than it is today,"" said United CEO Oscar Munoz and President Scott Kirby in a message to their employees last Friday. A leaner airline industry means some of the 750,000 jobs the industry had at the start of 2020 won't come back. Hundreds of planes will almost certainly stay grounded, which will mean less capacity and higher fares. Many of the low-cost seats that passengers have enjoyed booking will disappear.  Fliers will have less choice -- of airlines, of flight times, and of available routes and markets. All of that means passengers will pay more when they return to the air. ""Fewer seats flying means fewer cheap seats at the margin,"" Philip Baggaley, chief credit analyst for airlines for S&P Global. A long time to recover lost traffic This isn't the first time the airline industry has needed to contract in response to a sudden shock. Before the terrorist attack of 9/11 happened, there were nine major US airlines. Today most of those nine airlines -- iconic carriers such as Continental, Northwest, and US Airways - have been merged into four remaining major carriers -- American (AAL), United (UAL), Delta (DAL) and Southwest (LUV). Those four majors controlled 80% of the miles flown by passengers on US airlines last year. The rest of the market is taken up by smaller carriers offering cheaper fares, such as Spirit (SAVE), JetBlue (JBLU) and Allegiant (ALGT). The presence of those carriers helps keep some of the seats on the major carriers available at lower prices. But almost no one is flying today. The number of passengers entering TSA screening points fell 93% between Tuesday and the last Tuesday of March in 2019. It will take a long time for passenger traffic to recover, even after the coronavirus is under control and people can fly again. Traffic finally bounced back in 2004, following the 2001 terrorist attacks.  And after the Great Recession of 2008, it wasn't until 2013 that passenger traffic reached what it was in 2007, the final year before the Great Recession. Those drops in traffic were a mere fraction of the decline that occurred over the last four weeks. Less choices for passengers This coronavirus crisis is so much more severe than past downturns in the industry that there's a good chance there could be a new round of mergers and airline failures that the industry has gone through in the past. ""In the near term, we're going to see a shakeout,"" said Joe Schwieterman, a transportation expert and professor at DePaul University in Chicago. ""The weaker players may not survive this. Most industry leaders are expecting a long, painful recovery."" Even if all the current US airlines manage to survive, airlines big and small will pull back from markets and routes that have become unprofitable in the new environment. Even on routes they maintain, they'll reduce the frequency of flights to fill up a greater percentage of seats.  That will lead to higher fares than before the crisis.  ""There's going to be fewer airplanes. That means less flying,"" said industry consultant Mike Boyd. ""So there's going to be less choice, and you'll be paying more. There's no way around that.""  A new round of mergers? In the past, economic problems in the industry have led to bankruptcy and mergers. Many of the deals since 9/11 have taken place as part of a bankruptcy process.  From April through June of last year, US airlines' revenue totaled $64.4 billion, according to Transportation Department data. But the industry is getting only a small percentage of that revenue stream right now. Even with a $50 billion federal bailout, the government is only providing a fraction of the revenue lost in the current drop in air traffic.  So it's possible that two of the big carriers could once again merge, further consolidating control of the market.  What might work against a merger of the major carriers could be the nature of this crisis, said Philip Baggaley, chief credit analyst for airlines for S&P Global. He said previous bankruptcies and mergers helped airlines shed debt or get out of labor contracts they couldn't afford. This crisis is different. ""More than too much debt or their costs being too high, it's just the loss of revenue,"" he said. ""Unfortunately mergers or even bankruptcies can't address that.""  But a merger among majors is still possible as airlines seek to fill seats and further trim administrative overhead.  While such deals would need the approval of antitrust regulators, the Justice Department has rarely blocked airline mergers in the past, particularly at a time of financial crisis for one or both parties. And they could be approved despite antitrust concerns, said Joe Schwieterman, a transportation expert and professor at DePaul University in Chicago. ""There are all kinds of industries where there are only three or even two major players,"" he said. ""You could envision a deal among majors clearing antitrust hurdles, especially if the industry is on the ropes."" Also possible: the upstart, low-fare carriers could fail and be swallowed up by the bigger carriers. At the very least, they may have to drop out of their less profitable markets. But it's virtually certain that passengers will have fewer choices even if none of the airlines merge or go out out business, as airlines respond to the new, lower traffic environment with smaller operations for the foreseeable future.  "
Booze sales are booming as people stockpile alcohol... but it may not last,"New York (CNN Business)The coronavirus pandemic has forced millions of Americans to stay home, and they're drinking a lot of alcohol to pass time — for now. Alcoholic beverage sales shot up 55% in the third week of March compared to the same time a year ago, according to Nielsen. That's when several states, including New York, ordered people to ""shelter in place."" Those social distancing guidelines limited people from hanging out and restaurants and bars were ordered to close. However, many stores selling alcohol -- including liquor outlets or grocery stores -- stayed open. People quickly stocked up on spirits, wine and beer. Ready-to-drink cocktails, such as spiked lemonades or canned gin and tonics, grew the most: a 106% spike in sales, according to Nielsen. Hard seltzer sales also remained strong with White Claw and Truly remaining the top-selling brands.  Sales of beer, which has been gradually falling out favor with the American drinker, also soared. Nielsen said that larger packs of 24 or 30 both grew roughly 90% for the week compared to a year ago as people were preparing to limit their outside errands.  The week ending on March 21 will probably be the peak for alcohol sales, predicted Danelle Kosmal, vice president of Nielsen's Beverage Alcohol Practice Area. Subsequent weeks will be a ""better indicator of the new normal in how consumers are responding to the crisis,"" as people consume the alcohol they've stockpiled and as more Americans lose their jobs. Sales could fall this month if there's a deeper recession and people shift their spending to essentials like food, noted Laurent Grandet, an analyst at Guggenheim. He expects sales to remain strong for cheaper beer like Budweiser but warns that the craft beer industry will be hurt. Around 70% of its sales come from the brewer's taprooms or at bars, which are both currently closed in much of the US, he said.  ""It's a perfect storm for the craft beer business,"" he told CNN Business. He said they will further be harmed since retailers pick larger brands to stock their shelves because they're easier to get. Even when social distancing rules are eased and the country gets back to something resembling normalcy, the recovery in alcohol sales won't be immediate. People might still be wary of rushing back to bars or restaurants, and Grandet predicts 20% won't reopen. It will also take time for the supply chain to ramp up production again.  "
Can't find what you want in the grocery store? Here's why,"Analysis by Hanna Ziady, CNN BusinessUpdated 1947 GMT (0347 HKT) April 2, 2020Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.London (CNN Business)The coronavirus pandemic has delivered a shock to tens of millions of people in rich countries around the world: Suddenly, they can't buy the food they want, when they want.  Food supply chains in developed economies are showing increased signs of strain as nationwide lockdowns designed to curb the spread of the coronavirus heap pressure on systems that had very little slack to begin with. The result is empty store shelves, and panicked buyers.  The transportation links that move food around the globe are being tested in unprecedented ways. Shipowners are struggling to change crews and move goods between ports. Airlines have grounded thousands of planes, slashing air freight capacity.  Travel restrictions also are clogging up road networks and making it difficult for farm workers to get where they are needed. And at the end of food supply chains, supermarkets that have come to rely on just-in-time deliveries have been upset by huge demand and panic buying. Global stocks of staple commodities such as wheat, corn and rice are at healthy levels, said Maximo Torero Cullen, chief economist at the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. But logistics bottlenecks need to be identified and resolved quickly to ensure goods can get to where they are needed, and protectionist policies avoided, he added.  Kazakhstan, a major wheat exporter, temporarily banned shipments of buckwheat, rye flour, sugar, carrots and potatoes earlier in March because the government was worried about domestic supply. While the restrictions have since been eased, similar moves by other countries could be problematic. The food supply crunch is getting attention from top policymakers: Leaders from the Group of 20 major economies last week pledged to resolve disruptions to global supply chains and ensure the movement of vital medical supplies, critical agricultural products and other goods and services across borders.   Shipping on the front line Shipping would be a good place to start. The vast majority of the world's food supply is carried on ships, either in containers or on board bulk carriers. Yet shipowners, already reeling from shutdowns of some of the world's busiest ports in China, are now having to contend with sweeping lockdowns all over the world, hindering access to ports and making crew changes all but impossible due to travel restrictions. Maersk (AMKAF), the world's largest container shipping company, recently said it had suspended all crew changes for a month partly to minimize the risk of vessels being quarantined by port authorities and causing disruptions to customers' cargo.  But doing so puts the physical and mental health of seafarers at risk, as they remain on board ships for extended periods without a break, which could lead to crew shortages later on, the International Chamber of Shipping has warned. More than 30 ports worldwide are either restricting entry to vessels or prohibiting crew changes, including in Australia, Vietnam, India, Greece, Portugal, Chile and Argentina, according to Wilhelmsen, a maritime industry conglomerate based in Norway. Rules governing port access differ from country to country, and sometimes even within countries, making it very difficult for shipowners to plan routes, said Guy Platten, secretary general at the International Chamber of Shipping. This could snarl food supply chains, particularly for time-sensitive fresh produce, he added.  Delays in transit from ports in China are likely to cause apple juice shortages in the United States, according to a March 13 report by commodities research firm Mintec. Two-thirds of the apple juice Americans drink comes from China.  Air cargo restricted The shutdown in commercial aviation caused by coronavirus has sharply reduced air cargo capacity, making it harder and more expensive to move perishable goods that need to be delivered at speed. ""Passenger operations have been reduced so drastically that there is just not the capacity in the system to meet even the reduced levels of air cargo,"" Alexandre de Juniac, CEO of the International Air Transport Association, said in a statement on Tuesday. Shipments have been delayed as airlines struggle to arrange crews and get permission to fly because of travel restrictions, de Juniac said. ""Last week the European Commission published guidance which will help clear roadblocks in Europe. And we encourage other countries to follow suit,"" he added. Hiten Dodhia, a director of Saturnalia UK, a company that imports high-value fresh produce from Africa and South America and sells it to supermarkets in Europe, said there has been a huge hike in the price of air freight due to the grounding of so many passenger planes.  Lockdowns and curfews in countries including Zimbabwe, South Africa, Guatemala and Peru are restricting the movement of workers and causing labor shortages on farms, which will obstruct planting, harvesting and packaging, he told CNN Business.  The biggest problems lie with vegetables that are planted, harvested and shipped over relatively short time frames, such as mangetout, sugar snaps, baby corn, beans and tenderstem broccoli, Dodhia said. He has told some farmers not to plant because it is unclear whether their goods can be moved to market in time. Labor and logistics Labor shortages in Europe and the United States also threaten to seriously disrupt supply chains, push food prices higher and make certain high-value commodities, such as fruit, vegetables, meat and fish, hard to find.  Britain's National Farmers' Union has warned that travel restrictions could prevent migrant workers from getting into the country for the upcoming harvest, while a nationwide shutdown will hamper growers' ability to recruit the 80,000 seasonal workers needed this year.  ""We are urging the British people, university students, anyone looking for work, to mobilize behind British growers in this time of national importance and pick for Britain,"" the union's vice president, Tom Bradshaw, said in a statement.  Labor shortages in Europe are meanwhile likely to interrupt Britain's supply of imported fruit and vegetables in the coming months, according to the UK's Landworkers' Alliance, which represents more than 1,000 small British farms and is a member of the international smallholder farmers' movement La Via Campesina. ""Much of our produce comes from Southern Europe, where producers are already delaying and reducing spring plantings due to restrictions on movement of seasonal workers from Eastern Europe, illness, transport restrictions and cashflow,"" it said in a statement. The price of apples from Poland and broccoli from Spain jumped by roughly 20% between February and March, as consumers hoarded fruit and vegetables, according to Mintec. ""Traffic chaos at the German-Polish border has made transporting apples and other fruits problematic,"" said Mintec. Governments must resolve bottlenecks and ensure that perishable goods do not go to waste, said Torrero Cullen. Keeping labor-intensive packaging plants running at full capacity while still following social distancing guidelines will create an additional challenge, he added. No slack in the system Supermarkets, which are working around the clock to keep shelves stocked amid panic buying, are facing logistics headaches of their own. And just-in-time supply chains mean there is very little slack in the system.  Retailers generally hold between one to three weeks' worth of non-perishable items, such as pasta and rice, in stores and depots, with much lower quantities of fresh produce kept in storage, said Dave Howorth, executive director of Scala, an independent supply chain consultancy to the UK's food and drink sector.  ""Suppliers generally deliver on a daily basis because there's so little stock in the system,"" he added. But if shipments are delayed because of restricted access to ports, or suppliers are held up at border crossings, daily deliveries may not be possible. Photos of empty shelves and steps taken by retailers to ration purchases suggest that while there may be plenty of food out there, the systems that get it to where it's needed are being stretched.  This prompted the UK government to temporarily relax competition laws earlier in March to allow supermarkets to exchange data on stock levels, pool staff to meet demand, and share distribution depots and delivery vans.  Another factor driving demand at supermarkets: restrictions imposed by governments to reduce the spread of coronavirus mean that people are eating more at home, instead of in restaurants. ""It's a fundamental change. You've seen a significant switch in volumes, which has been overlaid with panic buying,"" said Howorth. Over the four weeks to March 21, UK shoppers made three additional trips to the grocery store compared to the same period last year, spending an extra £1.9 billion ($2.4 billion), according to Nielsen. An additional 1.2 million online orders were placed over the same period, the research firm said.  "
Half a million Americans were furloughed by major department stores this week,"New York (CNN Business)Hundreds of thousands of retail workers lost their jobs this week as the coronavirus pandemic continues to decimate the industry. Stores are closed and online sales are slow because people are holding back on discretionary purchases like clothing. It's anyone's guess when stores will be able to reopen or if demand will return when they do. That has forced major companies like Macy's, Kohl's, Gap and JCPenney to put roughly half a million people, ranging from hourly associates to corporate employees, on furlough this week.  In another effort to preserve money and in a show of solidarity, some of these companies have slashed pay for their executives and paused bonuses or raises this year. If there's some good news for the affected employees, it's that several of these companies are still providing healthcare.  Ascena The owner of Ann Taylor and Lane Bryant announced Monday it made the ""extremely difficult decision"" to furlough all of its store associates and half of its corporate employees. That amounts to roughly 40,000 employees, according to figures from a regulatory filing. Ascena's (ASNA) remaining corporate employees will have their salaries reduced by as much as 45%.  Gap Inc. Gap (GPS), which owns Old Navy and Athleta, said Tuesday it was putting 80,000 store employees and some of its corporate employees on furlough.  The company also said in a press release that Gap executives and its board are taking a ""temporary reduction in pay,"" although it declined to say how much. JCPenney The department store said in a statement Tuesday that it has made the ""difficult decision to temporarily furlough the majority of store hourly associates."" JCPenney (JCP) also said that a ""significant portion"" of its corporate employees will be placed on leave. It had about 90,000 employees as of February 1. Kohl's Discount department store Kohl's (KSS) said Monday it was furloughing workers at its stores and distribution centers, as well as some corporate employees. That amounts to roughly 85,000 employees, according to a spokesperson. Kohl's CEO Michelle Gass isn't taking a salary for the time being. Macy's Macy's (M) said Monday it was furloughing a ""majority"" of its 125,000 employees. The company said that the coronavirus has taken a ""heavy toll"" on its business, leading it to temporarily close its roughly 775 stores. The changes also affect Bloomingdale's and makeup retailer Bluemercury.  Macy's CEO Jeff Gennette and the company's board of directors will stop receiving their salaries, according to a regulatory filing. Neiman Marcus A ""large portion"" of the luxury department stores' 14,000 employees are being placed on furlough. CEO Geoffroy van Raemdonck said he's not taking his salary while employees are on furlough, and his direct reports are also waiving a ""significant amount"" of their salaries.  Urban Outfitters The trendy retailer was one of the first companies to shut its doors. Urban Outfitters (URBN) said Tuesday that a ""substantial number of store, wholesale and home office employees"" will be put on furlough. It's also not paying rent and is canceling new store openings.  ""This is the first time in our 50-year history we have furloughed employees,"" CEO Richard Hayne said in a release. ""It's a painful decision that we do reluctantly."" Urban Outfitters, which also owns Free People and Anthropologie, has roughly 24,000 employees according to regulatory filing. "
Men wash their hands much less often than women and that matters more than ever," (CNN)Handwashing with soap and warm water for 20 seconds -- along with staying home and standing six feet apart from others -- is the best weapon we have against the novel coronavirus that has infected almost 800,000 people around the world.  However, there's one big yet little discussed difference when it comes to this essential personal hygiene habit: Women are hands down better handwashers than men. Years of surveys, observations and research have found that women are more likely to wash their hands, use soap and scrub for a longer period of time than men after using the restroom. However, there's still a surprisingly large portion of both sexes who don't wash their hands at all. People lie about washing their hands Researchers have had to come up with clever ways to collect this data, since most people will tell you that they think handwashing after using the bathroom is important. That's even if they don't actually do it.  Carl Borchgrevink, director of the School of Hospitality at Michigan State University in East Lansing, takes this kind of survey data with a pinch of salt. ""If you're at a restroom at an airport, for example, and when you come out someone [asks] you 'Did you wash your hands?' And what are you going to say? Yes, of course,"" said Borchgrevink. When researchers only ask about people's handwashing habits, ""we found that the data that people were reporting seemed to be too high,"" he said.  To dig deeper into what people really do after using the bathroom,  Borchgrevink tasked 12 research assistants at Michigan State University with the job of surreptitiously hanging out in four different restrooms on and off campus to record what 3,749 men and women actually did. The results of the 2013 study were shocking to the researchers.  Few people wash their hands correctly Some 15% of men didn't wash their hands at all, compared with 7% of women. When they did wash their hands, only 50% of men used soap, compared with 78% of women.  Overall, only 5% of people who used the bathroom washed their hands long enough to kill the germs that can cause infections.  A bigger study published in 2009 that used more high tech methods at a busy highway rest stop in the UK was equally, if not more, damning.  With the use of wireless devices to record how many people entered the restroom and used the pumps of the soap dispensers, researchers were able to collect data on almost 200,000 restroom trips over a three-month period.  The found that only 31% of men and 65% of women washed their hands with soap.    It's a big gap -- clearly twice as many women as men were washing their hands,"" said Susan Michie, health psychology professor and director of the Centre for Behaviour Change at the Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology at University College London.   ""Another interesting result was that the more people were in the toilet area the more they were likely to wash their hands,"" said Michie, who was an author of the study. ""If there were no people around, people tended to zap out with no one noticing."" There's little to suggest that men in the UK and US are unsual in their handwashing (or lack thereof). A review published on the subject in 2016 looked at research from dozens of different countries, and found that women were 50% more likely than men to practice, or increase, protective behavior like proper hand-washing, mask-wearing and surface cleaning in the context of an epidemic, like flu.  Why is there a gender gap? There's been far less research done on why there is such a gap between the sexes when it comes to hand-washing. Michie said it was likely socially programmed behavior, not genetic. ""Women are more focused on care than men -- childcare, household care, personal care,"" she said.  Similarly, Borchgrevink said that while his study didn't look at why men didn't wash their hands as much as women, he suggested that it could be down to a sense that men were too macho to fear germs.   ""We did talk to some of (the men) and ask, 'why didn't wash your hands?'"" Borchgrevink said. ""And they would look at us indignantly and say, 'I'm clean, I don't need to wash my hands.' They had a sense of invincibility.""  Nancy Tomes, a history professor at Stony Brook University and the author of ""The Gospel of Germs: Men, Women and the Microbe in American Life,"" says the hand-washing gender gap has a long history dating back to when the germ theory of disease took hold in the public consciousness in the Victorian era -- that certain diseases were caused by microorganisms that invaded the body rather than bad air or miasma.  ""This changed the definition of cleanliness,"" she said, and women especially were told their family's health depended on the highest level of hygiene.  ""Of course, there had been definitions of what was clean and unclean before the germ theory came along, but it injected a level of specificity and also upped the ante. If you made a mistake in your cleanliness, you could die, your family could die. ""And that message of, 'make a mistake and your kid will die' resonates like a megaphone in the lives of mothers (even today),"" Tomes said.  Motivating men to wash their hands Michie's research at the highway rest stop in the UK looked at what kind of public health messaging would improve handwashing rates by using a sign that illuminated with different messages as people entered the restroom.   While the findings weren't conclusive, the study suggested that men and women responded to different types of messaging around handwashing. Messages that triggered disgust (""Soap it off or eat it later"") resonated with men, while women were more motivated to wash by messages that activated knowledge, such as ""Water doesn't kill germs, soap does."" Michie said she wasn't aware of any public health campaigns that had focused their efforts on men in light of their handwashing lapses, but said this was the perfect moment to try.   ""It's an excellent idea to target men. It could be really helpful. If women knew men weren't doing it, they'd get on to them."" "
Where to get health insurance if you just lost your job," (CNN)For millions of Americans, a job doesn't only mean a paycheck -- it also provides their health insurance. As unemployment surges amid the coronavirus pandemic, many laid-off workers will have to find new coverage -- a critical protection as more than 180,000 Americans test positive and many are hospitalized. A small piece of good news: There are more options for those who have to buy health insurance on their own these days, thanks to the Affordable Care Act. Here's where to look: Obamacare exchanges Those who've recently lost their job-based coverage can check out the policies available on the Affordable Care Act exchanges by going to www.healthcare.gov.  Just know that there's only a 60-day window to take advantage of this special enrollment period once their employer coverage ends, said Sabrina Corlette, co-director of the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University. While Obamacare plans can be pricey, the federal government provides premium subsidies for lower- and moderate-income folks -- a category many newly unemployed may fall into. Individuals with incomes up to roughly $50,000 a year or families of four making up to than $103,000 generally qualify for help.  Also, those with more meager earnings are eligible for plans with lower deductibles and out-of-pocket costs. They are open to individuals with annual incomes up to roughly $31,250 or families of four making up to about $64,400. However, those with very low incomes don't qualify for Obamacare subsidies, though they may be eligible for Medicaid in many states. Separately, Americans who were uninsured before the pandemic hit and are now seeking coverage can sign up for Affordable Care Act plans in the 11 states and the District of Columbia that all run their own exchanges. They have launched special enrollment periods that are available for a limited period of time. The Trump administration has decided not to reopen enrollment for the uninsured in the 38 states that use the federal exchange, a senior administration official said Tuesday evening. And, now would also be a good time for current Obamacare enrollees who've lost their jobs or are making less money to return to the exchange and see if they qualify for larger subsidies to lower their monthly premiums. Medicaid The newly jobless who've suffered major drops in income may qualify for Medicaid, particularly in the 36 states plus the District of Columbia that have expanded eligibility to low-income adults under the Affordable Care Act. Typically, in these states, individuals who make around $17,500 or less this year and families of four who earn up to about $31,150 are able to sign up.  But states look at one's income at the current point in time when determining eligibility, said Allison Orris, counsel at Manatt Health, a professional services firm. The monthly limits are roughly $1,470 for an individual and $3,000 for a family of four. Participants, however, are required to report changes in earnings in the future. People can generally apply online or over the phone through their state Medicaid agencies at any time, and most states can determine eligibility within 24 hours, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Medicaid provides comprehensive coverage with no or very low premiums and out-of-pocket costs, though it typically has a more limited network of doctors who accept it.  It's harder to qualify in states that didn't expand, particularly for those without dependent children. But kids could still be eligible for the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), depending on the state and their family income. While unemployment benefits typically count as part of one's income for determining eligibility for Medicaid or CHIP, the new $600 enhancement approved by Congress last week does not. COBRA Those who want to keep their job-based coverage usually can continue it for up to 18 months under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, known as COBRA. But this can be a very expensive option because one has to pick up the employer's share of the monthly premium too.  Total annual family premiums cost about $20,600 last year, on average, according to Kaiser. Employers paid about $14,600 of the tab. Single coverage costs about $7,200 annually, on average, with companies covering nearly $6,000 of the premiums. Some employers are continuing to cover their laid-off workers' health benefits, at least for a short period of time. Macy's, which announced Monday that it is furloughing the majority of its 125,000 employees, said it will pay 100% of premium for those enrolled in its health benefits at least through May. "
China's economy may not grow at all this year. That hasn't happened in 44 years,"Hong Kong (CNN Business)China's economy is showing some tentative signs of recovery from the devastation caused by the novel coronavirus pandemic but the path ahead remains hugely uncertain and growth could be entirely wiped out in 2020, putting millions of jobs at risk. GDP growth this year in the world's second biggest economy could sink to just 1% or 2%, down from 6.1% in 2019, according to recent estimates by analysts, including a Chinese government economist. In a worst case scenario, the $14 trillion economy may not grow at all, the World Bank warned earlier this week. That would be its weakest performance in 44 years, worse even than the troughs hit during the 2008-2009 global recession and in 1990, when the West imposed sanctions on China after the Tiananmen Square massacre. Analysts from UBS and Goldman Sachs recently slashed their estimates for China's growth this year to 1.5% and 3% respectively.  Even Chinese officials, who have set annual GDP targets every year since 1985, are wary of making predictions. A policymaker at the People's Bank of China (PBOC) said this week that the government should not set a target for 2020. ""It's difficult to even realize growth of between 4% and 5%. Many have predicted growth to fall to just 1% or 2% [this year]. These circumstances are all possible,"" Ma Jun, a member of the monetary policy committee at the Chinese central bank told the state-owned Economic Daily. Given the huge uncertainties in the outlook, China is finding it hard to determine how much fiscal and monetary stimulus to unleash, Ma said. An ""unrealistic"" growth target may encourage local governments to splurge on infrastructure investments, which do little to ease unemployment or improve people's livelihoods in the short term, he added.  More help needed Still, an official survey this week showing an anemic recovery in China's vast manufacturing industry last month, following a collapse in activity in February, was followed by news of more stimulus measures. China's cabinet on Tuesday announced more than 3 trillion yuan ($423 billion) in extra financial support for small businesses.  The PBOC will provide an additional 1 trillion yuan ($141 billion) to small and medium-sized banks, and cut the amount of cash they must hold as reserves. Both measures are aimed at boosting lending to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Previously, the central bank had injected liquidity or allocated additional lending worth more than 1.65 trillion yuan ($232 billion). The government had also allocated at least 116.9 billion yuan ($16.4 billion) in financial relief and stimulus aimed at fighting the virus. Tuesday's announcement included a promise from the government to double ""temporary cash handouts"" to low-income families and the unemployed from March to June. The government didn't specify how much it would give out, but said the move is estimated to benefit more than 67 million people. ""We believe ramping up financial relief for enterprises (especially SMEs) and households inflicted by the pandemic should be the best economic and social policies at the moment,"" Ting Lu, chief China economist for Nomura, said in a note on Wednesday. Beijing is also trying to revive the automotive industry after sales plunged 42% in January and February. The government will extend subsidies and tax breaks on electric vehicles by two years, while cutting sales tax on used cars from May through the end of 2023.  A private survey published Wednesday showed that China's manufacturing activity expanded ever so slightly in March, as factories reopened following the easing of widespread shutdowns and travel restrictions. The Caixin/Markit manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 50.1 last month from a record low of 40.3 in February. A reading above 50 indicates expansion, below 50 contraction.  The PMI data suggest the contraction in activity has bottomed out, but the economy has not recovered yet, analysts for Capital Economics said in a note on Wednesday. ""The [Caixin] survey suggests that just over half of firms saw conditions improve last month — implying that activity improved marginally relative to February's dismal showing but remains very weak,"" they wrote. ""The slow pace of improvement implied by last month's PMIs is consistent with our view that China faces a drawn out recovery from the Covid-19 outbreak,"" they said. Tens of millions of jobs at risk Capital Economics has one of the most bearish forecasts for China's economy this year. It estimates GDP shrank by as much as 16% in the first quarter, and predicts a contraction of 3% for 2020 as a whole.  China faces two major headwinds as it tries to get back on its feet — weakening foreign demand due to the global pandemic and a potential second wave of coronavirus cases.  Nomura estimates China's economy will grow by only 1% in 2020, causing millions of job losses.  ""We estimate that slumping exports alone could lead to a loss of 18 million jobs in [the second quarter],"" Lu wrote on Tuesday. Caixin will publish its survey of activity in China's services industry — which accounts for roughly 60% of GDP — on Friday. Whatever it shows, analysts expect the government will have to provide more help for the economy.   Tao Wang, chief China economist for UBS, said Beijing is likely to announce more support for individuals, the labor market and health care systems, more infrastructure investment, and additional cuts in interest rates.  ""Moreover, we expect the government to either lower this year's GDP growth target significantly or ... [focus it] instead on coronavirus control, work resumption, poverty reduction and supporting labour market,"" she said. "

Stuck at home but can't do your job remotely? Here's what to expect,"Today more than 225 million Americans are under orders to stay at home to help slow the spread of coronavirus. While many may be able to continue doing their jobs from home, a large number can't. That's because their job is done on-site at a business that has been deemed ""nonessential"" in the fight against the pandemic.  Think of anyone who works in customer-facing roles (e.g., in retail, hospitality, travel, or even bank branches that close). Or anyone who works with their hands, such as manufacturing plant workers, massage therapists, housekeepers or home health care aides. Or anyone who can't do their job when business comes to a standstill, like sales agents. How many employers are able to continue paying those idled employees -- and for how long -- is fast-changing.  As things unfolded in early March, a survey of 805 mostly mid- to large-sized employers by consulting firm Willis Towers Watson found a majority said they were still going to pay their idled hourly employees who couldn't work from home. But most -- especially retailers -- only promised to do so for 10 to 15 days at 100% of their workers' current base rate.   ""This week, the question is, 'Now what?'"" said Adrienne Altman, a Willis Towers Watson's managing director. One well known company has already answered: Macy's announced on Monday it would now furlough most of its employees, keeping on just a skeleton crew. Other employers are likely to announce their own decisions soon. Given the uncertainty about how long stay-at-home orders will be in place and how long the economy is going to be a mess, employers are having to make hard calls on the fly. Many are trying to figure out if they can afford to keep their idled workers on payroll -- even at partial pay. Or if they should furlough them with an implicit promise to bring them back when things improve. Or if they should lay them off altogether.  Furloughing can have benefits implications, said Mark Neuberger, at attorney in Foley & Lardner's labor practice. Depending on how a company's health plan is written, he said, the employer may continue subsidizing furloughed workers' health insurance premiums, whereas that might not be allowed for laid-off workers. Employers also are factoring into their decisions the new $2 trillion federal economic aid package that was signed into law last Friday. Several measures in the package seek to support workers and their employers as the country fights the pandemic. For example, one measure offers any worker laid off because of the coronavirus an additional $600 per week on top of their state unemployment benefit for four months. So a company that wants to temporarily cut costs might consider whether an employee wouldn't be better off on unemployment in the short-run.  For instance, in Florida, the average weekly unemployment benefit is $275. Under the new aid package that becomes $875 per week, which is better than the $600 a week that a worker making $15 an hour is paid. ""If you're a low wage worker you could be doing a lot better,"" said Chris O'Leary, a senior economist at the W. E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research. In instances where an employer has the means to continue paying its idled workers but at a reduced rate -- say, only half of what they normally are paid while working -- the employee still may apply for partial unemployment benefits to cover some of their lost income, said Michele Evermore, a senior policy analyst at the National Employment Law Project.

"When will you get your stimulus cash, and how?","Washington (CNN)The US government is preparing to send out direct payments to help individuals amid the coronavirus pandemic, but those who need the money most may be waiting the longest to see it. CNN's Betsy Klein, Manu Raju and Lauren Fox contributed to this report. The first payments are expected go out within three weeks to those for whom the Internal Revenue Service already has direct deposit information on file. Mnuchin said at a White House coronavirus briefing that payments would go out within two weeks to people whose direct deposit details are on file with the government, echoing comments he made after passage of the $2.2 trillion stimulus bill that payments would not go out until mid-April.  He added that a web portal would be established for people to supply their details and that checks would be sent to anyone else, but did not specify a timeline.  ""I am assuring the American public, they need the money now,"" he said.  It's unclear how long it will take to get the money to everyone else -- but it could take weeks or even months to send out checks. Trump administration officials told lawmakers it could take up to 20 weeks for all of the stimulus payments to be distributed, according to a House Democratic memo obtained by CNN. Previous stimulus payments in 2001 and 2008 have been delivered by both direct deposit and checks in the mail, but mobile payment services like Venmo want to play a role this time. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Sunday that there will be a web-based app for those whose information is not on file to register their payment details. The IRS will use your 2019 tax return, if you've already filed it, or your 2018 return to calculate the amount of your payment. The payments would not be subject to tax, and those who owe back taxes will still get the payouts. Individuals are due up to $1,200 and couples will receive up to $2,400 -- plus $500 per child. But payments start phasing out for individuals with adjusted gross incomes of more than $75,000. The amount will then be reduced by $5 for every additional $100 of adjusted gross income, and those making more than $99,000 will not receive anything. The income thresholds would be doubled for couples. Here's what we know so far about how it will work: Direct deposits will go out automatically The IRS says that payments will go out automatically to those who authorized a direct deposit for their refunds on either their 2019 or 2018 tax return. The money will be deposited directly into the same banking account and the taxpayer doesn't have to take any action to receive it.  That should cover a lot of people. Last year, about 92 million people received refunds via direct deposit. That represents about 82% of people who received refunds and nearly 60% of all tax filers.  ""I think it's reasonable to think those payments can be made in three weeks,"" said Nicole Kaeding, an economist with the National Taxpayers Union Foundation. Who will have to take action? For those who haven't filed a return for either 2019 or 2018, the IRS urges them to do so quickly.  Even those who don't normally need to file a tax return may have to in order to receive their payment. That includes individuals who earned less than $12,200 in 2019 and couples who earned less than $24,400. Language on tax forms can be unclear, especially for someone who hasn't filed a return in a while. Usually, the IRS has in-person taxpayer assistance centers located across the country -- but they have all been shut down due to the pandemic. ""An area of big concern is how much administrative burden we're putting on individuals to get these payments. We should be limiting it as much as possible,"" said Kyle Pomerleau, a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, where he studies federal tax policy. Social Security recipients will automatically receive stimulus pay The Treasury Department, clearing up confusion, said Wednesday that Social Security recipients will not have to file a tax return in order to receive the economic stimulus payments the government is preparing to send out.  It was unclear in earlier guidance whether Social Security recipients who don't normally need to file taxes would have to in order to receive the money. But, those beneficiaries will automatically receive the money, and the IRS will use the information that the Social Security Administration has on file. Those who normally receive their Social Security benefits directly in their bank accounts will receive the stimulus money in the same way. Others will receive a check in the mail -- though it will likely take longer to receive the payment than those who use direct deposit. Will others get checks in the mail? How things will work gets a little cloudy for those who have not authorized a direct deposit from the IRS either on their 2018 or 2019 return.  The IRS expects to start issuing paper checks the week of May 4, according to the House Democratic memo. The paper checks will be issued at a rate of about 5 million per week, the memo says. Individuals with the lowest income, based on adjusted gross income, will receive their checks first. In the past, it has taken longer to send checks than make direct deposits. In 2008, when the government distributed similar stimulus money, deposits were made over a three-week period, while paper checks were sent through the mail over a 10-week period. According to the legislation, the IRS has until the end of 2020 to transfer the payments.  An online fix? Now, the Treasury is planning to develop ""in the coming weeks"" a web-based portal that will allow people to provide their banking information to the IRS online so that they can receive their payments immediately.  But the government has said little about how this would work. ""I think it will be difficult to create that portal in such a time frame but we will see if Treasury can pull it off,"" Kaeding said.   It could be helpful for those tax filers who don't have up-to-date direct deposit or address information on record with the IRS.  Low-income earners could still miss out An online portal won't help the millions of people who don't have access to the internet at home.  It's likely that the portal will involve an authentication process and that could be a roadblock for some people.  For example, just 30% of people who try to register for an existing online account with the IRS are successful, said former IRS Taxpayer Advocate Nina Olson. The rest fail the authentication test, which requires an account number of a mortgage, loan or credit card, as well as a mobile phone that has the same address on the bill as your return. Not everyone can check all those boxes.  Lowering the authentication standards could invite identity theft, Olson said. This story has been updated with the Treasury Department's guidance for Social Security recipients and details of a House Democratic memo on IRS distribution timelines. "
"In rural America, cops are delivering groceries to vulnerable residents","New York (CNN Business)Major Bobby Reed of the Bourbon County, Kansas, sheriff's department had an idea when he saw that some stores were offering special hours just for elderly customers during the coronavirus crisis: He would start making grocery and prescription deliveries for at-risk residents himself. ""These people don't need to get out. They're in a vulnerable age group,"" the 10-year veteran of the department thought. So he posted on Facebook that he'd volunteer to deliver to elderly residents, shoppers with disabilities and veterans. His rural county, located five miles east of the Missouri border, has about 14,000 residents. The calls to Reed quickly came in quickly from residents who had to stay inside because of the coronavirus concerns or because they couldn't find an open slot for pickup at Walmart (WMT). The Walmart in the Fort Scott, Kansas, area doesn't deliver. Neither does the local grocery store. ""There's nobody else here local to do it. We're a rural community and we don't have Uber, Lyft,"" he said.  Reed now visits shoppers' homes with a mask and gloves. He takes their shopping list and cash and heads out to the store in his squad car. He also picks up their prescriptions from Walgreens (WBA).  In the first week, he made almost 40 deliveries. Other deputies at the department are also helping out. ""It's really taken off,"" he said. ""It's very rewarding. It's very humbling."" For residents in the area like Cheryl O'Brien, 56, who has heart and lung illnesses and had a pacemaker put in last year, Reed is her ""lifeline."" ""I was a little perplexed on how I was going to get everything I needed,"" she said. ""I thought I was going to have to put a mask on and risk catching something until I was told about this service."" O'Brien has been using Reed to pick up her medication. ""I felt bad because he has gone so many times,"" she said. ""Somehow, someway, I'm going to try to repay him when this is all over. It's something that I'm never going to forget. I just pray to God they stay safe."" The Bourbon County Sheriff's Office in Kansas is not the only rural law enforcement agency that has taken on the unlikely role of grocery delivery service during this pandemic. Reed got two calls from other sheriffs departments in Kansas that wanted to start similar services for elderly residents in their communities. It's also happening in Nebraska, Tennessee, Louisiana, Michigan, Missouri, Ohio, New Jersey and other states. In Appomattox County, Virginia, school resource officers are delivering groceries to elderly residents. Many small and family-owned grocery stores in rural areas have closed in recent years, making access to fresh food difficult. In rural Kansas, more than 100 grocery stores have closed since 2008, and in 50% of those communities a new store has not re-opened, according to the Center for Engagement and Community Development at Kansas State University. Small, rural grocery stores do not always offer delivery, said Rial Carver, project manager with the program. Delivery is labor intensive and ""some of these rural grocery stores operate with a very limited staff."" So during the coronavirus crisis, cops are stepping up to fill the void. Some have more time on their hands right now to make deliveries. ""With schools closing down, with courts closing down, our guys were going to have a lot of free time. So we wanted to do something that would help,"" Matthew Henderson, a spokesperson for the Lincoln Parish Sheriff's Office in Louisiana, told a local television station.  In Sarpy County, Nebraska, sheriff's deputies took on the role because scammers had been offering to pick up groceries and supplies for residents and taking their money. ""The idea behind it was to help defeat the scammers who had already started, and to allow those who should be quarantined to stay that way,"" Sgt. Kris Yount told NPR's Nebraska station. "
"What you need to know about coronavirus on Wednesday, April 1"," (CNN)President Donald Trump has warned of a ""very, very painful two weeks"" ahead, finally leveling with the American people about the desperate reality of the pandemic, and urging the country to prepare for loss of life at a magnitude unimaginable outside of wartime. A version of this story appeared in the April 1 edition of CNN's Coronavirus: Fact vs. Fiction newsletter. Sign up here to receive the need-to-know headlines every weekday. The President's grave warning was delivered against a backdrop of virus models that paint an alarming picture of between 100,000 and 240,000 potential deaths -- despite social distancing measures. Trump's marathon two-hour briefing mostly lacked the elements of self-congratulation and false hope that have characterized his heavily criticized leadership in the crisis, Stephen Collinson writes.  The President largely ceded the stage to his chief experts, armed with slides showing the rocketing rise of cases in New York and New Jersey. In a sign of the magnitude of the crisis, one of the more hopeful moments was a reference to Italy's downward curve in infections after weeks of agony. YOU ASKED. WE ANSWERED Q: Should I be wearing a mask right now? A: The WHO says you only need to wear one if you're sick or caring for a sick person, but US health officials are considering whether to recommend asking everyone to wear them -- a sign Asia may have been right all along. And there's an ongoing debate about which mask is best (not to mention a shortage of them), Jacqueline Howard writes.   WHAT'S IMPORTANT TODAY ""We are not at war""  In the latest sign that no one is safe from the virus, 70 US sailors are infected on an aircraft carrier.   The commander made this urgent plea to the Pentagon to save the lives of the ship's crew: ""We are not at war. Sailors do not need to die.""  Deadly day across Europe France, Spain and Italy each recorded more than 800 fatalities yesterday — but there are hopeful signs that cases in Italy are slowing.  In the UK, hopes that social distancing measures were starting to turn the tide were blunted by a record death toll of 381 yesterday, including a 13-year-old boy in London. And the government was forced to finally admit that its testing isn't up to snuff.   Can you sue over coronavirus? Tourists who may have contracted the virus due to an outbreak at an alpine ski resort are trying to. Officials in Austria are facing a class action lawsuit involving up to 2,500 tourists over an outbreak in a popular winter sports destination, Nadine Schmidt writes.  Fears of food shortages As farmers enter critical planting and harvesting times, fears are mounting that the pandemic could cause devastating food shortages around the globe. Farms need skilled laborers to work the fields, and a reliable supply chain to deliver their goods — but the outbreak has put both at risk, Danielle Wiener-Bronner writes. ON OUR RADAR One town in Wales has given a whole new meaning to ""herd immunity"" after a herd of wild goats took over its quiet streets. The world's largest lockdown is having a dramatic impact on pollution in India.  After their shifts end, doctors are taking to social media to combat an ""infodemic"" of inaccurate information.   Iceland is carrying out wide-scale testing on its population. Here's what they've learned.  From Kennedy's kitchen to Biden's basement, candidates are adapting to virtual campaigning.   TOP TIPS  How do you cope if someone you know dies from coronavirus? While social distancing measures bring a double trauma, there are still ways we can try to comfort one another, Sandee Lamotte writes.  In the absence of human touch, visual daily check-ins on video conferences with as many family members as possible can help in sharing grief.Setting up routines to remember loved ones who have passed — by writing letters to them, or sharing photos or memories with other family members — can help process the loss.Even with the most supportive family and friends, you might consider joining a support group. Many therapists are conducting virtual visits.

One block in America. Six businesses on the brink of disaster,"By Kyung Lah, CNNUpdated 1050 GMT (1850 HKT) April 1, 2020Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.Los Angeles (CNN Business)As of 2019, there were an estimated 30.7 million small businesses in the US, employing 59.9 million people, or almost half of the private sector workforce. Small businesses drive the American economy, but as the coronavirus pandemic has proven, they do so from a cliff. Many are about to fall off.  Behind those numbers are the actual people who own and work at the small businesses. It's impossible to tell all of their stories, but we can tell some. So last week we talked to the owners of six small businesses on a block of Colorado Boulevard in Los Angeles about their hopes and fears right now. The block and its businesses are very much unique, made up of a group of independently-owned stores in the heart of a gentrifying community in eastern Los Angeles. But you could transplant them anywhere in the country -- any town, any large city -- and the stories would be much the same.  Most of the business owners on the block are women, and many are minorities, reflecting a growing trend in the US. They went into what they do with a leap of faith — and a lot of financial risk. Now they're on the brink of ruin. Money may be coming from Washington in the next few weeks; they may not make it that long.  Below are their stories, as they told them. Quotes have been edited for length and clarity.  Valerie Brown, owner, Eagle Rock Community Acupuncture. Open since 2009.  ""I wanted to find a place where I could foresee there being foot traffic, Colorado Boulevard is great. I signed the lease in 2008. Both these financial times were and are gloomy, that's for sure. I didn't have as much at stake back then. I was moving into a situation where I thought, 'Oh, things are going to be getting better.' Now I'm in a situation where things were fine and now they're getting worse. I'm very attached to my community. When I go into Trader Joe's I know people. This business has been around for so long, we remember each other. I miss the connection. I feel for all of us shopkeepers.  If I know that we're going to be back in business up and running by May, I think I have enough to get by. If it takes until June, I still think I could do it, but I'd be awfully nervous. If it doesn't look like we can go back by June, I think I'm going to have to cease this business model because it's just not going to be viable. I sure hope that that's not the situation. I hope that at some point this year, we'll all be back to eating in restaurants, going to movies, getting community acupuncture. It would be heartbreaking because of all the connections I've made. And, you know, the patients mean a lot to me, and the community means a lot to me.  I do hope that California will find a way to be lenient with the small businesses and perhaps give us back some of the money that we've pre-paid in order to be in business in the year 2020. We'd need abatement on the rent. To have to pay rent, when we can't work, we'd be drowning in a lot of debt. So far from what I've heard, [the stimulus packages are] probably going to benefit big industries most. Probably hotels, airlines, things like that. Something funny I heard recently was, [what if] if the small business owners received the stimulus and Wall Street had to set up a GoFundMe account instead of it being always in reverse. I'm just not optimistic that something that would help small businesses and not give big handouts to the people who don't need it."" Samara Caughey, owner, Purple Twig, a children's art studio. Open since 2009.  ""It's always a financial risk, always a leap of faith to own your own small business. I started very small. I rented a storefront, did the minimum to get the space ready, and opened up. I hoped parents would drop their kids off to make art, and they did! Then it grew from there.  When I moved there, it was me and Peek-a-boo, a children's indoor play place. In the last 10 years, Colorado Boulevard has grown into a place that the community desires. A lot of the businesses are owned by women. The community has been welcoming. They all have an identity — each storefront. All have a passion, all believe in what they're doing.  This situation is very overwhelming, that's the best word I can use to describe it. We're all going through it. I don't feel like, 'oh poor me.' I'm trying to focus on creative thinking! I'm offering subscriptions for children age 5 to adults. Seems more important than ever to express yourself. I am also fortunate that much of my income comes from summer camp. As long as they register, I have income. If this goes on through summer, I will have to close. That would be such a shame. We are so important to this community in making it vital. If we have to shut down, so many would be affected.  I can hold on until the end of May. Hopefully we get a handle on this situation by then. A loan will not do anything for me or most of the shops on this street. Unless we can get grant funding, that's what we need. Leave the large businesses to get the loans. It becomes more and more apparent we're on a welfare system for the rich where we give millions to the large businesses. They can afford the loans. We can't.""  Jen Yates and Alex Hartunian, owners, Studio Metamorphosis, a fitness center. Open in this location since 2017. Alex: Any small business can owner can relate. It is not easy. Jen: We just put everything together and ... I mean scrounged every single dollar, every penny to open, and we did it. Alex did all of the construction there. He literally poured in blood, sweat and tears, with his own hands. Alex: It was really abrupt. We saw the world changing around us. And I was terrified. It was scary and Jen was equally scared. And we were just like, 'How are we going to survive... we're gonna wake up the next morning and have zero income. Like, how does that work?' Jen: When you put everything into watching something grow, and then it stops suddenly, it's so painful. I was sitting on the floor, just sobbing. Seeing it empty on a day where it should have been full was just heartbreaking to me. This has been my dream, opening up a studio. It was everything, our whole lives, and it's just gut wrenching.  Alex: Yeah, we're scared.  Jen: Yeah, I mean, I think each day, we look at each other and [think], 'How are we going to make this work, how are we going to stay afloat?' But yeah, we're scared like everybody else in the world, because the uncertainty is the scariest part of it. Alex: If we have like hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt in three, four months, what's the point? How will we open? Will people be ready to jump right back into business? Will people still be scared? And the more time goes on, the more the financial equation becomes looming in terms of like, a huge, huge problem. ... [Debt] forgiveness is going to be probably the number one thing that's going to put people at ease and make them comply with the stay at home order. People are scared so they're doing side work. People are getting out there and maybe perpetuating this virus. People want to know that if they hang tight [that] the government [will] tell us, 'Nothing's going to happen to your credit, you're not going to lose your home, you're not going to lose your place of business, and everybody just needs to be in this together.' That's the message out there, but we need to hear that from our government. Jen: We have to take care of our staff. I mean, we're not producing income, and they're not getting paid. And it's heartbreaking because they're starting their families and some of them are getting married now and they're beginning to start a whole new chapter in their lives, and they're so scared about what all this means for them. ... Alex and I will continue to fight and do whatever we can to generate some income to stay afloat. When challenges are presented I don't back away, and I'm going to keep moving forward and fight for it. Laura Porter, owner, Bloom School of Music and Dance. Open since 2008.  ""My husband and I started Bloom back in 2008. At first, it was just the two of us, teaching everything that we could teach, while holding down other jobs. Both of us have been musicians and educators for decades, and we were being sent all the kids who wanted to quit. We decided we wanted to teach music education differently. I want to build a school with teachers who have like minds, who treat every student completely individually. Let's feel and express the beat in different ways, hear the rhythmic echoes and play games and feel that joy before we tell them to sit still and listen to the adults. It's really brought all of us together and sharing. Sharing ideas, trying to figure out a better way to do something, and really feeling like we're in it together. It's not showing up between three and eight to do your thing and then you're going home. You know, everybody in the whole school is thinking about this 24-7. We're kind of approaching our business in a lot of ways like educators — How can we do this better? How can we make it more engaging? How can we bring more joy? Like most of the schools across the country, everyone's on Zoom, [somehow,] doing live streaming, to keep things going. So far, we're holding strong. It's not April 1st yet so that's when payments are due. But right now we're holding strong. It's so frightening because it's a day-by-day thing. You know, I can't even look at September because there's no history in our lifetime for this, right? For anyone, it's not just the businesses, it's all the people that have supported those businesses over the years.  [Elected officials] have to listen to the average American out of work. They always talk about how important it is for everybody to spend. If they're out of work, they can't spend. They have to put themselves in other people's shoes and small businesses are a big part of that. [If] they help small businesses, it can help the people that work for them."" Michelle Helseth, owner, Native Boutique, a clothing store. Open in this location since 2014.  ""I bought my house here when my daughter was three, so 19 years ago. I always wanted to open up a shop in our neighborhood. I think this block, this is the heart of the neighborhood. You could do everything from buying wine to cheese to having breakfast and lunch. Going shopping, buying a gift, to having your kids get educated with arts and music and dance or just going to having a children's birthday party next door. We just have everything on this block, all independently owned, all individual owners, majority women-owned. The whole world is trying to process this new reality. It's so fictional. This is something we would see in a movie theater but it's happening. As far as business, it's just come to a screeching halt. And then workman comp's insurance tried to draw from my account. I have no staff, what's the point? So I have to call my workman's comp and say, 'You know I have no staff right now so there's no reason for you to deduct my account.' I just invested in all this inventory. And so I'm extended, expecting for sales pick up in March and April, to get us back where we needed to be. I wish I was able to have reserves. We just don't. We're a small business where I'm a single mom. It's not like I have a husband bringing another income or, or a partner, I don't. This is my everything here. I'm concerned about going deeper into a hole, more debt. We need financial support to help us get through this from our government. We need grants, not just loans. You know, if they're going to give us loans, [it should be] zero interest loans.  Our businesses are the frontline of keeping our neighborhood safe. If we're not here, creating a pleasant, happy, beautiful environment for community for shoppers, for families, for residents ... How safe will the community be when you're having blight on your main shopping boulevard?"" Michelle Wilton, chef/owner of Four Café. Open since 2010. ""I definitely cycle through every emotion. I get angry, I get sad. I think what makes me the saddest is just our employees. I have this overarching sense of responsibility for their lives as well and to provide for them. So, that has been really hard for me trying to just navigate. I need to pay them, they have children. We just haven't generated enough sales to even cover the labor on some nights so myself and our other business partner ... have been working. He's been working in the front of the house and I've been doing all the cooking. We're just really waiting to see what the stimulus is, because if the stimulus comes out and says that they're going to help pay for our staff, then we want to get everybody scheduled immediately just to give them hours, of course. But right now the reality of it is if we don't make the sales we can't pay for the labor. We just added a whole grocery section of online ordering where people can buy toilet paper, they can buy a dozen organic eggs, organic milk, any of our cookie dough, or organic bread... they can pull up curbside and pop their trunk and we put it in and it's a complete, no-contact way of shopping. I put sourdough bread kits on our site, we started pizza kits, hopefully it will generate more business so that we can employ more staff. I had to reinvent the whole thing. Anything I can to help generate business and help employ our staff, that's my number one thing, we have staff that have kids and I just get so worried about them. I have two small children, a four-year-old and an eight-year-old, and it has been tricky trying to succeed at all things. Because now I'm a homeschooling mom, so I do that in the morning and then I go to work ... and I'll go and bake or prepare. My husband will take over with the kids behind me, but we haven't taken them out. My son has asthma so it is a little scary."" -- CNN's Kimberly Berryman contributed reporting.  "
UK races to convert a convention hall into hospital for coronavirus patients,"London (CNN)The United Kingdom will open the doors this week on what could soon be the biggest intensive care unit in the country -- and it was built in about a week. As the number of Covid-19 cases in the UK began to rise, the National Health Service (NHS) realized it might be short of many thousands of ICU beds. It hopes the solution lies in a massive convention space in London's East End, the ExCel Center -- a venue more accustomed to showcasing the latest ventilator technology than actually using it. The coronavirus field hospital will be called NHS Nightingale, after the pioneering nurse Florence Nightingale. ""Oh my goodness, there is no comparison,"" said Natalie Forrest, when asked about the hospital's scale. Normally an executive at London's Royal Free Hospital, Forrest is the operational guru responsible for transforming the empty halls into a functioning hospital in less than a week. When fully running, it will have 4,000 beds. Just a few dozen were ready at the time a CNN crew visited. Electricians were still running cables, plumbers installing sinks, and vast halls were still stacked with plastic-wrapped machinery. ""Obviously we don't want to use those beds,"" Forrest said. ""If we have to use this facility, which again I really hope we don't... we will need thousands of doctors and nurses and volunteers to run this facility."" Medical director Dr. Alan McGlennan said he was most concerned about staffing, rather than equipment. ""Critical care nurses are in very short supply,"" he said. NHS Nightingale won't be a hospital in a traditional sense. There will be no front door, no waiting rooms. But the site will provide vital extra critical-care capacity for London's hospitals as pressure grows. ""We will be receiving patients from ICUs across London,"" Forrest said. ""So not all types of patients -- just patients who are sedated and ventilated, and need to be cared for in an ICU."" Britain has more than 25,400 coronavirus cases, with nearly 1,800 deaths, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University. "
"Andrew Jack, 'Star Wars' actor, dies from Covid-19"," (CNN)Andrew Jack, a British actor and dialect coach who had roles in a number of ""Star Wars"" movies, has died aged 76 after contracting Covid-19, his agent has said.CNN's Max Ramsay contributed to this report. Jack played Major (and then General) Ematt in ""Star Wars: Episode VII -- The Force Awakens"" and ""Star Wars: Episode VIII -- The Last Jedi.""  He also worked as a vocal coach on a number of blockbuster movie franchises, including ""Guardians of the Galaxy,"" ""The Lord of the Rings"" and ""The Avengers."" Jack's agent, Jill McCullough, said in a statement that he died on Tuesday in a hospital in Surrey, England, as a result of the coronavirus. ""Andrew lived on one of the oldest working houseboats on the Thames, he was fiercely independent but madly in love with his wife, also a dialect coach, Gabrielle Rogers,"" McCullough said. ""Tragically she is stuck in quarantine in Australia, having just flown in from New Zealand last week. She was unable to see or talk to him at the end of his life and there is a chance a funeral may not be held.""  ""He was still working full pelt, currently coaching on the new Batman,"" McCullough added, referring to ""The Batman,"" which is set for release in 2021. ""Dialect coaching isn't just about being good at accents -- you need to make your actors feel safe and confident -- and Andrew's actors adored him."" Jack had a long-running association with the ""Star Wars"" movies and had roles both in front of and behind the camera. He also had voice parts, including as Moloch in ""Solo: A Star Wars Story."" American actor Sean Astin, who worked with Jack on ""The Lord of the Rings"" movies, paid tribute to him on Twitter, saying that he ""made a mean curry"" and ""was powerful & gentle in equal measure."" ""Andrew Jack loved a unique theory of gravity, that we are all being pushed down, instead of pulled down. We loved Andrew Jack,"" he added. Producer Christopher Miller, executive producer of ""Solo: A Star Wars Story,"" tweeted: ""Andrew Jack was the dialect coach on SOLO, and a kind and thoughtful man. We asked him to teach Alden to speak Shyriiwook, and I'll always remember listening to them gargle-roar at each other back and forth."" "
"5 things to know for April 1: Coronavirus, census, prisons, election, Venezuela","If your day doesn't start until you're up to speed on the latest headlines, then let us introduce you to your new favorite morning fix. Sign up here for the '5 Things' newsletter. (CNN)It's April Fools' Day, but understandably, not many people are in a joking mood.  Here's what you need to know to Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day.  (You can also get ""5 Things You Need to Know Today"" delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) 1. Coronavirus  President Trump issued a grave, sobering warning during a coronavirus briefing, preparing the country for 100,000 to 240,000 coronavirus deaths in the coming weeks. It is the first time the administration has laid the numbers bare in such a straightforward way. Dread is spreading in other parts of the world as well, like in Hong Kong, where beauty parlors, night clubs and karaoke rooms have been shut down as the region contends with a second wave of coronavirus cases. The CDC now says that as many as one-fourth of those infected with the virus could be walking around with no symptoms and transmitting it, which makes social distancing measures all the more crucial. This growing public concern has led China to start counting asymptomatic cases in its official tally. There are now more than 860,000 coronavirus cases worldwide and more than 42,000 deaths. Follow here for live updates.  2. Census  It's Census Day in the US, when local leaders encourage people to complete and return their census forms. That part's not optional -- participation in the census is required by law -- but there are plenty of reasons to comply. Census numbers determine how many representatives each state gets in Congress and how billions of dollars in federal funding get spent. Schools, roads and other crucial community components will gain -- or lose -- money over the next 10 years depending on this official population tally. This is also the first time the census can be completed online. If you don't complete the forms, expect a visit from a census taker later in the year who may interview you to make sure everyone is counted.  3. Prisons  The coronavirus crisis is having a particularly dangerous impact on prison systems. The US federal prison system announced it will move to a heightened state of lockdown as it fights the spread of the disease behind bars. This means inmates will largely be confined to their cells for a two-week period. Prisoners in Washington DC and Texas are suing their correctional systems for better access to soap and paper towels amid the outbreak. Some inmates reported having to use the same towel to bathe, dry their hands and clean their cells. Meanwhile, dozens of inmates have tested positive for Covid-19 at the Cook County jail in Chicago. It's the largest single site jail in the country, and the rise in cases means it could become a hot spot for the disease.  4. Election 2020 It's a new frontier for politicians campaigning in the age of social distancing and lockdowns. Local leaders are connecting with voters from their homes or through Facebook Live events, and Democratic presidential front-runner Joe Biden has been broadcasting (and podcasting) from his home in Wilmington, Delaware. Biden's campaign also released a new digital ad responding to the coronavirus crisis, casting the former vice president as a leader who could empathize with Americans during difficult times. As July's Democratic convention edges closer amid the pandemic, New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania are to latest states to push their primaries to June. Wisconsin, however, is still planning to hold its election on Tuesday.  5. Venezuela The Trump administration has launched a new effort to oust embattled Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro in hopes of facilitating a democratic transition in the ailing socialist state. The plan points to Venezuela's coronavirus response as a reason to get rid of Maduro. Under the plan, Venezuela's National Assembly would create a Council of State to serve as the governing body until presidential elections are held. This new strategy comes less than a week after the US Justice Department announced narco-terrorism charges against Maduro and senior Venezuelan leaders.  BREAKFAST BROWSE A 112-year-old British pensioner is the world's oldest man  That's a LOT of birthday candles.  A few tips to survive working at home with your spouse  Don't look each other in the eye.

Companies making medical supplies say feds aren't taking charge," (CNN)Days after the Trump administration enlisted manufacturers to mass-produce medical supplies to address the coronavirus pandemic, medical and ventilator manufacturing companies said they have pressed the federal government to take on the role of deciding where to place their supplies. But those calls, these companies said, have gone unanswered.  Meanwhile, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which has recently taken the lead on federal coordination, also appears to be struggling to get supplies where they need to go.   That's left states on the front lines, which are still trying to get necessary items to treat patients as the death toll climbs, coming up short.  New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo called on FEMA and the US Health and Human Services Department on Tuesday to do better. ""Time to say to that federal government that the FEMA, the HHS, you have to learn how to do your job and you have to learn how to do it quickly, because time is not our friend. It's about a social stamina,"" the New York Democrat said.  ""We're desperate for it,"" Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on ""The Situation Room,"" referring to personal protective equipment. In an advisory to stakeholders this week, FEMA said it will allocate supplies based on ""data-informed decisions"" that will be coordinated between the government and the private sector.  But companies are calling on the government to take a more active role and decide which states and counties should receive which types of ventilators. A spokesperson for Medtronic, one of the world's leading makers of medical devices, said the company wants the federal government in charge. ""It is Medtronic's strong preference that the federal government in the form of FEMA and HHS take over the allocation of ventilators,"" the spokesperson said.  Medtronic is scaling up production at its plant in Ireland to roughly 600 high-performance ventilators a week, up from about 100 a week under regular circumstances. ""Our biggest push that we have been continuing to make is for FEMA and HHS ... for them to really take on the role of the allocator,"" one ventilator executive said, adding that the lines of communication with the federal government have been ""completely open."" ""We're doing our best based on what we're hearing from states, from the federal government and from (foreign) ministers of health, but we're only one company with one aspect of the solve,"" the executive said.  The Trump administration, under mounting pressure to fill supply shortages, is turning to private companies to manufacture items, like ventilators and personal protective equipment, for hospitals inundated with coronavirus patients. Late last week, after urging from state leaders, President Donald Trump invoked the Defense Production Act to require General Motors to produce more ventilators to deal with increased hospitalizations.  Trump said Tuesday that there are almost 10,000 ventilators being ""held back"" from distribution because ""the surge is coming.""  ""We have to hold them back, because the surge is coming, and it's coming pretty strong and we want to be able to immediately move it into place without going and taking it, so we're ready to go.""  Trump previously said he thinks it would be difficult to get equipment back from states and redistributed once it has been issued to hospitals.  Another manufacturer said it is trying to scale up production to meet demands but that it's ""not set up to triage orders in terms of severity."" The spokesperson said the situation can ""become unwieldy quickly,"" as the company tries to work with all 50 states, plus the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the federal government at once.  CNN reached out to FEMA for comment.  An agency within the Department of Homeland Security, FEMA at first filled a supporting role for HHS. Its infrastructure and know-how on disaster response put the agency in a unique position to help with the coronavirus outbreak. But facing a quickly evolving nationwide pandemic, FEMA also appears to be in a scramble of its own.  In some cases, states have expected shipments only to have them suddenly shifted elsewhere. Lamont reiterated Tuesday that his state had been promised another federal shipment of personal protective equipment, but at the last minute FEMA told him that Connecticut had more than a three-day supply and consequently the agency would reroute the promised shipment elsewhere. Similarly, Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts requested information on how the federal government plans to get equipment to her state in a letter to FEMA Administrator Pete Gaynor, adding that two orders of supplies had been ""seized by federal authorities while en route to the Commonwealth.""  Washington, one of the states hardest hit by coronavirus, is also facing challenges in obtaining supplies.  ""When we ask for supplies and equipment that they're unwilling to give us, the rationale is because they're more needed elsewhere,"" a Washington state official told CNN. ""We're concerned because we've seen increases in deaths and the rate of growth of the virus in many parts of our state outside of King County and believe we have significant needs and growing needs across our state,"" the official added. ""Despite some early signs of improvement, it's clear we have a long way to go."" "
"Asia may have been right about coronavirus and face masks, and the rest of the world is coming round","Hong Kong (CNN)In the coming weeks, if they have not already, your government is likely to begin advising you to wear a face mask to protect against coronavirus.  For those living in Asia, such announcements will be a vindication of a tactic that has been adopted across much of the region since the beginning of the crisis and appears to have been borne out by lower rates of infection and faster containment of outbreaks.  In other parts of the world, this message may be confusing, coming after weeks of public health authorities, politicians and media figures confidently claiming masks do not help and urging people instead to focus on washing their hands and maintaining social distancing.  The tone of such claims ranged from condescending to frustrated, with the US Surgeon General Jerome Adams tweeting in late February -- in all caps -- ""STOP BUYING MASKS!""  ""They are NOT effective in preventing general public from catching #Coronavirus, but if healthcare providers can't get them to care for sick patients, it puts them and our communities at risk,"" he added, in a post that has since been retweeted over 43,000 times.  That same week, Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), appeared before lawmakers. Asked if people should wear masks, he had a straightforward answer: ""No.""  Now he's not so sure. On Monday, Redfield said told NPR that the CDC was reviewing its guidelines and may recommend general mask use to guard against community infection. It's likely only a matter of time before other mask holdouts, most prominently the World Health Organization (WHO), follow suit.  Pivot to protection Writing last month, Adrien Burch, an expert in microbiology at the University of California, Berkeley, noted that ""despite hearing that face masks 'don't work,' you probably haven't seen any strong evidence to support that claim. That's because it doesn't exist."" In fact, there is evidence of the exact opposite: that masks help prevent viral infections like the current pandemic.  Burch pointed to a Cochrane Review -- a systemic analysis of published studies on a given topic -- which found strong evidence during the 2003 SARS epidemic in support of wearing masks. One study of community transmission in Beijing found that ""consistently wearing a mask in public was associated with a 70% reduction in the risk of catching SARS.""  SARS, like Covid-19, is a respiratory illnesses caused by the same family of viruses called coronavirus. While SARS spread around the world, the worst of the epidemic was focused in Asia, particularly mainland China and Hong Kong. The legacy of this experience could be seen early on in the current pandemic, as news of a virus spreading led people across the region to don face masks to protect themselves.  From the beginning, Hong Kong and many other Asian governments have recommended people wear masks in public, whether they are showing virus symptoms or not. Despite eye-rolling in some parts of the Western press, and talk of Asia's ""obsession"" with face masks, the tactic appears to have contributed in helping to stem the outbreak.  Taiwan, South Korea and mainland China, all places with widespread mask use, have seen greater success in preventing major outbreaks or reining them in once they begin than in Europe and North America where masks are either not used or hard to come by.  Speaking to CNN, Ivan Hung, an infectious diseases specialist at the Hong Kong University School of Medicine, said that ""if you look at the data in Hong Kong, wearing a mask is probably the most important thing in terms of infection control."" ""And it not only brings down the cases of coronaviruses, it also brings down the influenza,"" he said. ""In fact, this is now the influenza season, and we hardly see any influenza cases. And that is because the masks actually protected not only against coronaviruses but also against the influenza viruses as well."" At the beginning of March, Hong Kong had only around 150 cases of the virus, despite being on the frontlines of the pandemic since it began and not instituting many of the more draconian population controls seen elsewhere. The city has only seen a spike recently after people began returning to the city from Europe and the US.  ""Based on the research, face masks are much more likely to help than to hurt,"" according to Burch. ""Even if it's just a homemade cloth mask, if you wear it correctly and avoid touching it, the science suggests that it won't hurt you and will most likely reduce your exposure to the virus.""  Heightened contradictions In its guidance on the coronavirus, the CDC notes that it spreads primarily ""through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneeze,"" which ""can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.""  The agency recommends that people who are sick wear a face mask or otherwise attempt ""to cover your coughs and sneezes,"" while those caring for them should also wear a face mask whenever they are in the same room. Yet, in the same advice, the CDC said that non-symptomatic ""do not need"" to wear face masks, adding that they ""may be in short supply and they should be saved for caregivers.""  And this is what has been so frustrating and confusing for many people, particularly those who advocate for wearing face masks as a precaution. The CDC, along with the WHO and several other public health bodies and experts, has been simultaneously claiming that masks do not offer protection in ordinary circumstances, while stating they are necessary for health workers and caregivers.  This conflicting advice helped create confusion and no small amount of hostility towards officials who people felt were lying to them and putting them at risk. There were numerous replies to Adams' tweet about masks in February asking ""why are masks good for healthcare workers but not for the public?"" Writing last month in the New York Times, Zeynep Tufekci, a professor of information science, said that ""to help manage the shortage, the authorities sent a message that made them untrustworthy.""  ""Providing top-down guidance with such obvious contradictions backfires exactly because lack of trust is what fuels hoarding and misinformation,"" she said, adding that if officials were concerned about shortages, they should have stated this outright, and asked people to donate masks they had bought to hospitals, not claimed they were ineffective in the first place.  ""When people feel as though they may not be getting the full truth from the authorities, snake-oil sellers and price gougers have an easier time.""  Masks work Trying to avoid mask shortages for healthcare workers appears to have been the main priority of those arguing against widespread their widespread use. But while the motivation behind this may have been good, such advice may have actually helped spread the virus, thus adding to the number of patients overwhelming hospitals.  One of the reasons the CDC's Redfield gave for potentially changing the guidance on masks is that the coronavirus can be spread when people are asymptomatic, and therefore having everyone covering their faces -- as has been the norm in Hong Kong and other parts of Asia since January -- could help rein in transmission.  That the virus is spread before people feel sick is not news, however. It's been widely supposed since the first weeks of the outbreak, and evidence has only grown stronger in recent months.  And even if there was not asymptomatic transmission, universal or near universal mask wearing has its uses. As others have noted, instructing only the sick to wear masks is essentially asking people to put a sign on themselves inviting fear and hostility, whereas if everyone wears a mask when outside, the sick are more likely to do so, thus protecting people around them.  The lack of masks and other protective equipment in hospitals across the US and other countries should be remedied as fast as possible. But these shortages were caused by policy failures and supply chain issues, not a sudden run on 75 cent paper masks by concerned members of the public.  As the evidence increasingly comes round in favor of masks, we must ask how many infections might have been avoided if in January, instead of saying masks wouldn't help, officials and the media had instead lobbied for factories to ramp up domestic production, provided guidance on how to make masks at home, and asked other countries to donate surplus materials?

Dr. Anthony Fauci describes his 'very different' relationships with 5 presidents," (CNN)Dr. Anthony Fauci gave CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta some insight into his ""very different"" relationships with each of the presidents he's served under as the nation's top infectious disease expert.CNN's Maegan Vazquez contributed to this report. Fauci, who has served as the director of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases since 1984, has worked as a key adviser on national health crises under six administrations. In a new episode of Gupta's ""Coronavirus: Fact vs. Fiction"" released Wednesday, Fauci described how each administration brought a new relationship with the White House as each president faced unique health crises -- all the way up through his current relationship with President Donald Trump.  LISTEN: The full episode of Coronavirus: Fact vs. Fiction with Dr. Sanjay Gupta When asked by Gupta to describe his interactions with each of the presidents under whom he's served, Fauci replied, ""You know, they're different with every president, Sanjay. And within a given presidency, it's different."" ""I had no interaction with President Trump for the first three-plus years because there was not any reason to interact. We were doing our job. You know, he was doing what what he was doing,"" Fauci said. With the coronavirus outreak, ""all of a sudden, now I'm in a situation where I spend like more than an hour every day with him,"" Fauci added. ""I mean, we go there, we brief him, we have a press conference, we debrief after the press conference."" ""The answer to your question, a little bit long-winded, is that it's very different with each president and it's dictated almost completely by the circumstances that you're under,"" he said. Fauci, who has been a pragmatic, data-driven presence during the White House coronavirus task force briefings, has frequently dissented with Trump's claims pertaining to the outbreak, having refuted the President to his face and spoken publicly about working to get Trump's professed falsehoods ""corrected for the next time.""  The veteran doctor spoke in glowing terms about his relationships with earlier presidents. He highlighted his close relationship with President George H.W. Bush, noting that ""just by accident I developed a really close friendship with him because he came to the (National Institute of Health) in the late 80s when he was vice president and was thinking of running for president, and he sincerely wanted to learn about HIV."" ""He was a very modest, unbelievable human being. And he came in, he says, 'I want to learn,'"" Fauci said, adding that he introduced Bush to patients at NIH and ""gave him a bit of a tutorial on HIV."" ""And all of a sudden he decided he was going to be my friend, thank goodness, and he invited me to the White House ... we had a very warm, personal type relationship,"" Fauci added.  His relationship with President Bill Clinton ""was different,"" Fauci said.  ""Clinton had all the right vibes about what to do. I had a good relationship with him, but it was quite formal, as you would have with respect to the presidency,"" he said. Fauci said that he got to know President George W. Bush amid the crises of 9/11 and the 2001 anthrax attacks before he ""had the privilege of being close to him and developing PEPFAR,"" or the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. Fauci considers Bush's PEPFAR -- an unprecedented, $3 billion-a-year program to help the world fight AIDS -- ""one of the most important things any American president has ever done,"" he said, noting that ""it saved millions of lives."" President Barack Obama was ""a very easy person to get along with and a really good, good human being,"" Fauci said, highlighting the ""marathon"" of outbreaks at the time, including Ebola and Zika. ""He didn't joke about it because he was serious, but I remember once he walked into the into the Situation Room and we were sitting around and he just put his hand on his head,"" Fauci said. ""He said, 'I got children at the border, I got wars going on, and I'm spending all my time with these diseases. Would you guys please do something about this?' It was it was sort of like almost tongue in cheek, but it was serious,"" Fauci recalled. "
Understanding the virus: Iceland lab's testing suggests 50% of cases have no symptoms," (CNN)There's a lot about Iceland that other countries could envy: Its spectacular natural surroundings, its place among the world's happiest countries, and, now, its large-scale testing for the novel coronavirus, which could influence how the world understands the outbreak. Minali Nigam contributed to this report.  Experts have said comprehensive testing is key to controlling coronavirus, and creating a more accurate picture of the spread of Covid-19. This island-nation of 360,000 is doing just that.  As of Tuesday, Iceland had tested more than 17,900 people for the virus -- nearly 5% of its population. And while its National University Hospital tests people who are high-risk or show symptoms, nearly half of Iceland's tests have been conducted by biopharma company deCODE Genetics, focusing on the the wider population.  Crucially, deCODE's ""screening program accepts everybody who is not showing symptoms and not currently in quarantine,"" Iceland's Directorate of Health said in a statement, adding that Iceland-based company was doing it on the behalf of the Chief Epidemiologist and the health agency.  What have been the main findings? DeCODE, a subsidiary of US biotech company Amgen, has so far tested about 9,000 self-selected people. ""The results of the additional tests performed by deCODE have given an indication that efforts to limit the spread of the virus have been effective so far,"" the government wrote last week, adding ""testing in the general population will continue to elicit a much clearer picture of the actual spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in Iceland."" Some of the revelations have been stark. Although fewer than 1% of the tests came back positive for the virus, the company's founder Dr. Kári Stefánsson told CNN that around 50% of those who tested positive said they were asymptomatic, confirming multiple studies that show that asymptomatic, or mildly symptomatic, people have played an important role in spreading the virus.  ""What it means in my mind, is that because we are screening the general population, we are catching people early in the infection before they start showing symptoms,"" Stefánsson said. ""Keep in mind that the screening is now randomized, but voluntary so there is some bias in the data,"" the Directorate of Health said in a statement, adding that a ""randomized screening program has started and a blood serum screening for antibodies is planned."" The work has also helped researchers to visualize the spread of the virus. ""We can determine the geographic origin of the virus in every single [virus] in Iceland,"" he said, adding there are specific, minor mutations for the virus that came from Italy, Austria and the UK. ""There was one that is specific to the west coast of the United States,"" he added. Stefánsson wonders whether mutations in the virus are ""responsible, in some way, for how differently people respond to it -- some just develop a mild cold, while some people need a respirator,"" or whether a person's genetics dictates their condition. ""Or is it a combination of these two?"" he asks.  His company is in a better position than most to answer that question, as it already has the medical and genotype data of nearly half of Iceland's population.  Why has Iceland chosen not to implement a lockdown? Iceland has yet to take many of the draconian measures seen across Europe and Asia of state-wide lockdowns, though the island country has banned gatherings of 100 people or more and closed secondary and tertiary schools.  Officials say more restrictive measures haven't been needed because they were better prepared and armed with data to track the virus.  ""Testing and contact tracing are one of the key reasons why a lockdown has not been considered necessary up to this point,"" its Directorate of Health said in a statement to CNN.  ""There is also another reason, no less important, we have pursued a very aggressive policy of quarantine for individuals -- suspected to be at risk of having contracted the virus -- for much longer and at a higher scale than most other countries we are aware of."" Iceland began testing its population in early February, weeks before its first coronavirus-related death, Stefánsson said, adding that health officials have aggressively contact-traced and quarantined confirmed and suspected Covid-19 cases. Government data shows that there are 1,086 confirmed infections in Iceland and 927 people currently in isolation, while more than 5,000 have left quarantine.  ""The only reason that we are doing better is that we were even more vigilant,"" he said. ""We took seriously the news of an epidemic starting in China. We didn't shrug our shoulders and say, 'this is not going to be anything remarkable.'"" Stefánsson expects the company to test at least 50,000 people -- around 13% of the population -- before the virus has run its course.   ""It is extraordinarily important to know what the distribution in the society in general is because when you're designing measures to contain the virus,"" health officials need to know if the virus is running rampant through the community or circulating among clusters, he said.  Iceland has not been immune to supply shortages. Stefánsson said there were problems obtaining swabs for the tests, but these have since been rectified.  Could they provide a roadmap for other countries? He says Iceland could help countries develop models for the spread of the disease, or to help researchers understand community transmissions.  Many have observed that Iceland's small population helps it to helps it to carry out widescale testing, but Stefánsson disagrees. ""It's nothing to do with the size of the population, this has to do with how well prepared it was"" for the pandemic, he says. He adds that many developed countries have an ""amazing collection of talent"" who could have ""industrialized tests like this a long time ago"" but ""behaved like nothing was happening.""  "
Can the Tour de France go ahead without the 'soul of the sport?'," (CNN)With the list of sporting postponements growing ever longer, the fate of cycling's Tour de France would seem almost inevitable.Yu Chan Wang and Aleks Klosok contributed to this repor The world's most prestigious bike race takes place annually in France and sometimes the surrounding countries. One of the most supreme tests of sporting endurance, the event is also embedded in French culture and society, will millions of fans lining the roads to watch the Tour. Which perhaps explains why organizers have remained tight-lipped about how the Tour -- currently scheduled to begin in Nice on June 27 -- might be impacted by the novel coronavirus outbreak, which has brought Europe to a standstill. France's sports minister Roxana Maracineanu has suggested that the race, one of cycling's three ""Grand Tours"" alongside the Giro d'Italia and Vuelta a Espana, could go ahead behind closed doors. READ: Fixing 2021 sporting calendar will be like a 'huge jigsaw puzzle' ASO, the sporting group which organizes the Tour de France, declined to comment on the scheduling of this year's race, but Kazakhstani-based team Astana has questioned whether it should go ahead. ""In my opinion, we can only continue with these big competitions if the whole crisis is resolved,"" team manager and former pro cyclist Dmitriy Fofonov told CNN Sport. ""And it should be resolved not only in France but around the world, as all the teams have athletes from all around the world. ""Even without (the) public, we are traveling with many athletes and staff during the Tour. If just one of them is infected with the virus, everyone's health at the Tour is at risk. ""As team managers, we cannot take any risk. Sometimes you have to take a step backward before you can move forward again."" The NTT Pro Cycling team echoed that sentiment. ""We will diligently follow the respective race organisers and the guidance of the UCI and will welcome the resumption of the racing calendar in due course upon their instruction; but of course our first priority lies with the global COVID-19 pandemic and standing in solidarity with those affected across the world."" Unlike other sports, the Tour does not rely on ticket sales to make it financially viable. But the sight of exuberant fans lining the roads of rural France is what makes it so unique. ""It wouldn't be the Tour without the fans,"" 2018 champion Geraint Thomas told the Telegraph after the Paris-Nice race concluded without spectators. ""Paris-Nice is Paris-Nice and the Tour is the Tour. It would be a lot harder to keep fans away from the Tour than it was at Paris-Nice."" READ: New dates for Olympic Games confirmed for 2021 'Urgent battle' After starting in Nice, this year's route crisscrosses France before concluding on Paris' Champs Elysees on July 19.  According to Johns Hopkins University, there are more than 45,000 cases of the coronavirus in France, with non-essential public places closed since March 14. Maracineanu said last week that it is ""too soon"" to comment on how the Tour might be impacted by the virus given the ""urgent battle"" the country is fighting. And teams agree that cycling should be a secondary concern right now. ""If the situation is under control in a few months of course we would hope to compete, but only if the current conditions have improved significantly and it is safe to do so,"" a spokesperson for UAE Team Emirates tells CNN Sport.  ""If the Tour is canceled it would be a blow for cycling but public health must come before sport in these times. We trust that if the race goes ahead under any format that it will be done because the relevant authorities have deemed it safe to do so."" Riding solo In the meantime, teams continue to prepare for the tour as best as possible with facilities closed and social isolation rules in place.  ""All our planning at the moment is towards the Tour de France going ahead as planned,"" BORA-Hansgrohe team manager Ralph Denk told CNN Sport. ""Even (though) fans are the soul of our sport, we would be fully motivated to race the Tour without (supporters in) attendance if this ensures safe racing for everybody. ""At the moment all riders are at home training alone ... Our coaches are in touch with them on a regular basis and as usual everybody gets individual training plans."" READ: In a world gripped by fear, marble racing proves welcome distraction Fofonov's Astana outfit, which, like a number of other teams, withdrew from races earlier this month amid the coronavirus, is in the same boat with riders training alone.  ""Some can still go outside, some need to stay inside at all times,"" said Fofonov. ""Like always they receive an individual training plan from our trainers and coaches. The only difference this time is that nobody knows when they will be racing again."" The Giro d'Italia has already been postponed after the Hungarian government announced it would not be able to host the opening stages in early May, while the Vuelta a Espana is still scheduled to take place from August 14 to September 6. Last year Egan Bernal was crowned as the first Colombian to win the Tour de France and the youngest in more than a century. "
Navigating child custody in the time of coronavirus," (CNN)For years, Erika Lenkert's 14-year-old daughter has spent four days a week at Lenkert's house in San Francisco and three days a week at her dad's place in Marin County, about a 30-minute car ride north.Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team. But amid the Covid-19 pandemic, the family's custody arrangement has been anything but regular. The girl's father is dating a clinician who is working the front lines at an area hospital, and neither parent was comfortable with the possibility of increased exposure.  So Lenkert and her ex talked, and they agreed to temporarily modify the custody agreement until the public health threat diminishes. The teenager has been living in San Francisco full-time ever since.  ""We wanted to minimize the potential for her to get exposed and the ripple effect that could cause,"" says Lenkert, an editorial services director. ""[She] misses her dad but understands the rationale."" Across the country, divorced parents are grappling with similar situations and equally difficult decisions. Shelter-in-place orders, regional lockdowns and overarching health concerns have forced parents to modify their usual custody schedules and rewrite routines. In cases like Lenkert's, where the relationship is amicable, the changes have gone relatively smoothly. In other cases where parents are estranged, improvisation has necessitated billable hours with divorce attorneys and unearthed old wounds, making an already stressful time even harder.  This anxiety is only exacerbated by a family court system that basically has shut down like all other non-essential parts of society. ""Every day, all day long — it's the number one issue we've dealt with in our office over the last three weeks,"" said Jodi Lazar, a divorce and family lawyer in Austin, Texas. ""I'm sure it will be number one for the foreseeable future."" A regular routine disrupted One part of the current custody challenge is logistical. Many divorced parents who live close to each other exchange kids at schools or workplaces, most of which are closed. What's more, parents who live in separate towns risk violating shelter-in-place orders if they go too far out of their way to drop-off or pick-up a child. As for parents who live in different states? Most would agree it's too risky right now to have children fly alone. Another part of the conundrum is medical. How do you know your ex is taking social distancing as seriously as you are? How do you know your ex's new partner is keeping himself or herself safe enough not to infect your child? These are legitimate questions that many divorced parents are asking right now. ""I'm not worried about [my ex-wife] exposing our kids to risk, but I have thought about variables I can't control when they're there,"" said Jason Schoenfelder, a single dad in Chicago.  Schoenfelder's girls, ages 10 and 7, usually split their time evenly between his place and their mother's house. But because she works in a hospital, they've been spending more time with him. ""I think it's natural for a single parent to wonder, 'How safe are my kids going to be when I'm not controlling the environment?' But ultimately I trust that their mom has their best interests in mind,"" Schoenfelder said. Current custody orders are in effect The biggest obstacle for divorced parents during the coronavirus pandemic is legal. Most state and county family courts are closed, or open only for emergencies involving abuse or endangerment. This means that even if parents wanted to formally modify pre-existing custody agreements, they can't. Lazar, the Austin attorney who specializes in family law, said the Texas Supreme Court issued an emergency ruling that indicated parents should follow current custody orders pursuant to the schedule that was in place before the shutdown. The order also stipulated that stay-at-home provisions of specific counties or cities do not override the possession schedule. ""This might not have been what parents wanted to hear, but the [ruling] provided certainty,"" said Lazar. Other states have left rulings vague. In Massachusetts, for example, John D. Casey, chief justice of probate and family court, last week issued an open letter that said, ""both parents should cooperate."" Interpretation of divorce laws are equally vague in Connecticut, where attorneys are advising clients to put any temporary tweaks to the original custody agreement in writing, save hard copies of all correspondence about changes to the agreement, and embrace flexibility on both sides. Erik Broder, a divorce attorney in Westport, said in particular he's advising clients to propose virtual meet-ups on FaceTime, Zoom or Skype for parents who don't actively have custody, and ""makeup time"" for those parents who offer to tweak the schedule now in exchange for additional time with their children later in the year. Still, Broder admitted that even with outside mediation, some situations will never be easy. ""There's no question there will be parents who try to weaponize the [pandemic] to prevent another parent from spending time with a child,"" he said. ""Unfortunately, without cooperation, there's not much recourse [right now]."" Negotiating with an ex Jihong Larson, a Chinese-Canadian living in Dallas, Texas, understands the frustration that ensues when agreements can't be modified.  Larson and her ex-husband currently operate under a split custody arrangement — a plan that says they get equal time with their two children, ages 14 and 11. Earlier this month, when Larson began to worry about growing anti-Asian sentiments in her community, she asked her ex-husband for permission to take their half-Chinese children back to Canada until the pandemic passed. Her ex refused, and Larson has relented, at least for now. ""We're in the middle of a custody battle, and he doesn't want to lose his position,"" she explained. ""I'm worried about the safety of our kids, and I got a letter from [my ex-husband's] attorney warning me not to do anything to jeopardize the custody arrangement."" The threat is real. Marcia Zug, professor of law at the University of South Carolina, wrote in a March 24 post for The Conversation that judges may reduce visitation and custody for parents who interfere with their ex's custodial rights. ""You want to do what you feel is in the best interest of your child, but it's a real gamble because you don't know what the courts are going to do once they get going again,"" Zug told CNN in a subsequent interview.  ""Normally the court isn't going to rule in favor of a parent who violates a custody and visitation agreement. It's possible courts will change the approach because of [coronavirus], but if they apply the same framework as they always have, it will be rare for them to find this sort of thing justifiable."" In these crazy times, perhaps the best option for navigating a contentious custody situation is mediation. This process can provide a roadmap of where each parent stands; a roadmap that could help judges sort out specifics of custody changes down the line. It's better to mediate if possible Alison L. Patton, a family attorney who has practiced mediation for 11 years, said notarized temporary modification agreements also can serve to provide answers at a time when most courts can and will not. ""We're writing stipulations that specify they are binding at the time you sign them, even if it's not made into an enforceable court order until later,"" said Patton, who is based in La Jolla, California.  ""When we put together mediated agreements and stipulations, we make clear this is a temporary change, no precedent is being set, and that things will return to normal once the extenuating circumstances have ended,"" she said. ""We spell out that these modifications can't be used later as part of a power play."" Of course, the best-case scenario is still for parents to work it out amongst themselves.  Just ask Betsy Carmody, chaplain of a boarding school near Washington, D.C. She and her ex-husband have been divorced since December 2019, and they amicably revised the custody agreement for their 12-year-old daughter in March after her father started working from home. Specifics of the new agreement are simple. Previously, every week their tween spent more time with Carmody than her dad. Now, after some minor tweaks to the schedule, she spends about 50 percent of the time with each parent. The arrangement frees up both parents to do their jobs and be present for their daughter, who has expressed a certain degree of anxiety over the pandemic herself.  ""We're still a family, we just live in different homes,"" Carmody said. ""That was true for all of us before [the coronavirus] became an issue, and it will be true for us afterward, too. We have to do what's best for everyone. And I know we will."" "
Grief and fear after a coronavirus death: Managing a double trauma," (CNN)In the midst of heartbreak we are alone, unable to reach out and comfort those who mourn, standing a careful six feet from each other. Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.Correction: A previous version of this story misspelled Jane Webber's name. There is no great gathering of family and friends to honor our mothers, fathers, grandparents, spouses, brothers, sisters, children or friends so suddenly and cruelly ripped from our lives. There is no wake, no shiva.  Instead, we must listen to the tinny sound of the funeral emanating from laptops or smartphones, wishing our sorrow and support could race through digital space and surround those in agony with a hug or a touch -- the most basic of human comforts.  This is the grim face of grief and loss in the age of coronavirus.  ""The rituals around death are so important for healthy grief,"" said David Kessler, who co-authored the book ""On Grief and Grieving,"" with legendary bereavement expert Elisabeth Kübler-Ross. ""Grief is a time of connection. We've always been able to be with their bodies, to gather for a funeral. All that is gone,"" Kessler said.  ""So we're not only robbed of our loved one, but we're also robbed of our ability to gather to honor them. On a national level, this is really unprecedented.""  A special type of grief Much of what we are going through is reminiscent of wars and terrorist attacks, said trauma counselor Jane Webber, a professor of counselor education at Kean University in New Jersey. ""Similar to 9/11, not being able to say goodbye, not being able to see your loved one's body, imagining what they may have suffered, those memories stay with people, and they often need help to heal,"" said Webber, who counseled survivors and families during 9/11's tragic aftermath.  What's uniquely painful today, she says, is that after a loved one dies, families are trapped in quarantine, unable to touch and comfort each other, living in dread that another family member could fall ill. ""Dread is a combination of not knowing, fearing and terror,"" Webber said. ""Do you go pick up groceries? Are gloves enough? Should I touch the mail? Your child sneezes. You're living in fear every moment. ""Where we suffer most is that we want to hug someone. We need human touch and we're denied that,"" she added. ""There is no measure of how painful it is or how horrible it is for people right now."" Doing the best we can Unique times call for special measures, experts told CNN. Families should immediately connect in the most visual way possible. ""Connect through FaceTime, Skype, other social media,"" Webber said. ""We need to see each others' faces to know that the rest of our family is with us in spirit even if they can't be with us physically."" Webber suggests daily check-ins with as many family members as possible, perhaps on a group platform like Zoom. Consider it a ""virtual shiva,"" she says. If that's not possible, use the next best thing, said Tom Dening, who directs the Centre for Old Age and Dementia at the University of Nottingham in the UK. ""The main thing is for the key people in the life of the deceased to communicate with each other, to share their grief by whatever medium ... they feel comfortable with,"" he said. Try to keep the funeral as visual as possible too, Kessler suggests. It's important to see the faces of the friends and family who have gathered to honor and grieve the deceased. ""We are going to have to start gathering virtually with the minister on the Zoom and as many people as possible, instead of pretending we're still doing it at the church,"" he said. Some people may decide to put off the memorial service or funeral until after the Covid-19 pandemic passes. Kessler says that while that makes sense, it's his experience that a service of some kind should occur within the first few weeks after death. ""I'm concerned if people postpone them,"" he said. ""There's something important about grieving when grief first hits. People who don't have these rituals seem to have more trouble grieving."" Coping with guilt Guilt, one of the stages of grief, can begin to plague us as we mourn our inability to say goodbye. ""Some degree of guilt is so often present in normal bereavement -- we usually think of things that we might have done or said differently -- but it is likely to be exaggerated with Covid-19,"" Dening said.  ""Our experience is going to be complicated by the fact that we may feel that our loved one has died isolated and unsupported by us,"" he added. ""On reflection, we might remind ourselves that we couldn't have done more, but this may not be enough to suppress such feelings."" ""If the death is sudden or unexpected, and we did not get a chance to tell them how much they meant to us and how they changed our life for the better, we suffer even more,"" said Barbara Sahakian, a professor of clinical neuropsychology at the University of Cambridge. Take time to remember the loved one you lost, Sahakian suggests. ""Although in the early stages of grief we can feel overwhelmed by sadness, at that time, it is important to remember that we would not have become the person that we are without having experienced knowing them,"" she said. Webber suggests setting up family routines in which two or more loved ones gather visually or on the phone and share photos and tall tales of their loved one who has passed. ""Try to remember the happy parts of the person who has died,"" Webber said.""It keeps the human touch going. Even if it's not physical touch, it's emotional, it's spiritual, it's intellectual touch. We need that kind of relationship and grieving or we are left with unfinished grief -- and that's a scary thing."" While it may sound sad, Webber also suggests going through photos and watching old videos of your loved one. ""Write letters to your loved ones,"" she suggests. ""Write a letter every day, before you go to bed. Talk to the loved one and just say, 'This is what I wish I could have said to you.' ""By doing that, you are finishing some of the business that you weren't able to do,"" she said.""If you don't do it, I would worry about depression, maybe even suicidal thoughts.""  Get support Even if you have the closest, most supportive family and friends in the world, consider joining a support group. Just a few months ago, you would have been able to meet people in person who are experiencing the same grief. Another reality of this surreal time -- support groups are no longer meeting in person. But that doesn't mean you must forgo this very important tool for healing. Counselors and therapists are conducting virtual visits and support groups; they are also popping up on social media.  ""We have virtual support groups now as the only way people can share their fear of death and grief which have all mixed together,"" Webber said. ""We're grieving, but we're also afraid that we might get infected as well. So we have kind of a double tragedy, a double trauma going on here.""  "
White House: Next 30 days are crucial," (CNN)On a day several more states, including Florida, told most of their residents to stay at home, the number of US coronavirus cases skyrocketed past 200,000 on Wednesday.CNN's Sonia Moghe, Raja Razek, Jacqueline Howard, Jamiel Lynch, Allie Malloy, Joe Sutton, Dave Alsup and Jason Hoffman contributed to this report.  The news comes while debate revs up on whether all Americans should be wearing a mask. As of Wednesday afternoon, more than 210,000 people in the United States have been infected, and at least 4,703 have died. The number of fatality reports again reached a new daily high, with more than 900 reported. One of the deaths was a 6-week old in Connecticut, Gov. Ned Lamont said. More data showing people without symptoms are fueling the spread has top US officials rethinking whether the general public should be wearing masks. But the World Health Organization, while it says it is reviewing its advice, tells people there is no need to keep your mouth covered if you are not a patient or health worker. A quarter of people in US who are sick have no symptoms Concerning new data from Iceland shows 50% of those who tested positive said they were asymptomatic.   In the US, an estimated 25% of coronavirus carriers have no symptoms, said the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  ""Information that we have pretty much confirmed now is that a significant number of individuals that are infected actually remain asymptomatic. That may be as many as 25%,"" CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield told NPR.  To prevent further spread, the top infectious disease expert in the US says health officials are reconsidering guidance on face masks. Dr. Anthony Fauci said he would ""lean towards"" recommending that the general public wear face masks ""if we do not have the problem of taking away masks from the health care workers who need them."" ""We're not there yet, but I think we're close to coming to some determination,"" Fauci said. If federal officials recommend widespread use of face masks, it would be a stark reversal from recommendations by the World Health Organization and the CDC, who have said face masks should be worn only by health care workers, those who are sick, and those who are taking care of someone sick. The organization is ""continuing to study the evidence"" about whether the general public should use masks during the coronavirus pandemic, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said during a media briefing in Geneva, Switzerland, on Wednesday. The WHO recommends the masks for sick people and caregivers, he said.  ""This is still a very new virus, and we are learning all the time. As the pandemic evolves, so does the evidence, and so does our advice,"" he said. US Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams had consistently recommended the public not wear masks, saying they can cause more harm than good.  But this week, new information about asymptomatic spread could change public guidelines, Adams said. A major argument against the widespread use of masks is that health care workers don't have enough.  ""We have a massive global shortage,"" Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO health emergencies program, said. ""Right now, the people most at risk from this virus are frontline health workers who are exposed to the virus every second of every day. The thought of them not having masks is horrific."" In many cities, doctors and nurses are falling sick with or dying from coronavirus. This is doubly tragic because fewer health care workers are able to take care of the public.  So some people are making their own masks. JOANN Fabrics and Craft Stores released a video tutorial on how to make face masks.  Evidence shows social distancing helps Nearly 90% of the US population now lives in areas that have stay-at-home orders, according to a CNN count based on various state, county and city orders. Some say that's not enough and are calling for a national shelter-in-place order, especially because the deadly virus is twice as contagious as the flu. Florida, with 21 million residents and a large senior citizen population, joined the list Wednesday.  Gov. Ron DeSantis issued an executive order directing seniors and people with underlying medical conditions to stay home. All Floridians must limit their movements, he wrote. The order takes effect early Friday. Governors in Georgia and Mississippi also issued orders Wednesday. While 12 states have not issued stay-at-home mandates, President Donald Trump said he doesn't think a national order is necessary. ""States are different and I understand that the governor of Florida, great governor, Ron DeSantis, issued one today and that's good, that's great. But there are some states that are different. There are some states that don't have much of a problem,"" Trump said at a news conference on the US coronavirus response.  Health officials say social distancing efforts seem to be paying off, including in Washington state's King County -- the country's first coronavirus epicenter. ""We are looking at reductions in person-to-person contact that have progressively improved and have led us to a point where we are making a very positive impact,"" said Dr. Jeff Duchin, the public health officer for Seattle and King County. In hard-hit New York, a CNN analysis shows the day-to-day average of case increases in the past week was 17% -- a major decrease from 58% for the previous seven-day period. And a large-scale study found that early interventions, such as social distancing and severe restrictions on people's movement, have already saved tens of thousands of lives across Europe.  Scientists at imperial College London studied interventions in 11 European countries and concluded that they ""have together had a substantial impact on transmission.""  The researchers estimate as of March 31, ""interventions across all 11 countries will have averted 59,000 deaths."" You asked, we answered: Your top coronavirus questions Equipment still in short supply The calls for help with vital equipment for treating patients continue. One hospital CEO even went to Twitter on Wednesday to ask Tesla head Elon Musk whether he could supply ventilators. ""We are down to one critical care ventilator,"" the message from the account of Mark Geller said about Montefiore Nyack Hospital. Hospital spokeswoman Lauren Malone told CNN in an email that Geller ""decided it was worth sending a message"" to the Tesla head. ""We have not heard back from Mr. Musk, but perhaps we will be lucky enough to receive ventilators,"" Malone said. The hospital was able to obtain 10 ventilators from another source, Malone said. CNN has reached out to Tesla for comment. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said the state has been talking to factory owners from China and other countries, trying to buy equipment. ""We know that not having gotten nearly enough from the federal government, we have really taken it upon ourselves as a state to engage in the purchasing of medical equipment,"" he said. Polis said the state doesn't have the hospital beds, ICU units, ventilators and personal protection equipment to treat all potential patients. He said they have ordered some supplies, but, for instance, need to make sure the masks they bought aren't counterfeits. Why worry about coronavirus when the flu has killed more people? CORRECTION: This story has been updated with the correct percentage of Americans under a stay-at-home order. "
"April Fools' Day? Please, let's not this year"," (CNN)America, listen: We're in the coronavirus era now. By today, a good portion of the population will have been cooped up in their homes for several weeks, talking to their houseplants and reminiscing about what it was like to go to restaurants. And if the cabin fever doesn't get to them, surely the global cloud of human suffering will. That doesn't make for a jocular vibe. So let's take this opportunity to clarify something: April Fools' Day pranks are not funny right now. Don't do them.  Many people have been pretty clear that April Fools' Day is all but canceled this year, seeing that pretty much every day for the past few weeks has felt like a terrible prank.  Even Google, which traditionally shares April Fools' Day pranks and jokes across its platforms, is abstaining from such tomfoolery this year, according to a Business Insider report. And if you still think something like a coronavirus prank may be a big laugh, keep in mind a few things that could happen: You could get arrested. You could endanger other people's lives. And, at the very least, your friends and family will know just how unfunny you really are. Thinking of pretending you have coronavirus?  In the US, a man who allegedly coughed in the direction of a grocery clerk and said he had the virus was charged with making a terrorist threat in the third degree, according to the New Jersey Attorney General's office. Looking to cause a scene? A Missouri man who filmed himself licking items on a Walmart shelf while saying ""Who's afraid of the coronavirus"" was charged with making a terrorist threat in the second degree, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported. Another woman in Pennsylvania is facing criminal charges after intentionally coughing on grocery store produce, CNN reported last week. The store had to throw out $35,000 worth of food as a caution.  Even local officials in different countries have asked citizens not to pull any coronavirus pranks this year.  In Thailand, the Attorney General's office warned people against spreading fake news, the country's English-language newspaper Nation Thailand reported.  And in India, Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh announced on Twitter that legal action would be taken against people pulling coronavirus stunts on WhatsApp and other social media platforms.  Your messy attempt at a prank may not earn you a criminal record, but consider what will actually happen if you hop onto Facebook and say, ""Hey ma, I've got coronavirus!""  Not only will your loved ones worry about you, you'll send anyone who's had contact with you in the last two weeks into apoplexy. You may even get health officials poking around asking questions, or end up taxing already-suffocating medical resources with your foolery. Be sure to tell the exhausted health care worker who has to deal with you that it was ""just a joke."" They'll find it hilarious. April Fools' Day pranks have always been a dicey endeavor, but they're going to be even more difficult to pull off if you can't even get close to someone. No, that's not a challenge.  Social distancing bubbles are sacred now. We're literally being tasked with keeping each other healthy. Is that enough to sacrifice for whatever scheme you've cooked up in your self-isolated sopor? Here's a better April Fools' Day prank this year: Stay very far away from people, wash your hands, and don't pluck at the few fragile little threads holding together our collective sanity.  It'll be a hit. "
Power-hungry leaders are itching to exploit the coronavirus crisis,"London (CNN)As Covid-19 brings the world to a halt, some world leaders have spotted an opportunity to tighten their grip on power. In Hungary, a bill passed on Monday which handed Prime Minister Viktor Orban the power to rule by decree -- indefinitely.  It gives him the authority to punish journalists if the government believes the reporting its not accurate and allows the government to hit citizens with heavy penalties for violating lockdown rules. It also prevents any elections or referendums from taking place while the measures are in effect.   The move led to calls for the European Union to act, with Italy's former Prime Minister, Matteo Renzi, going to far as to suggest the bloc kick Hungary out if the measures were not revoked -- something that's far easier said than done.  Orban's move is perhaps the most flagrant power grab to take place during this pandemic. However, other strongman leaders have spotted the opportunity to seize greater authority.  In the Philippines, President Rodrigo Duterte -- a man who arrests his critics and has boasted about personally killing suspected criminals during his time as mayor of Davao City -- has secured emergency powers, giving him greater control of public services.  Earlier this month, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faced criticism after his government approved the electronic tracking of patients, using technology that had previously only been used in the fight against terrorism. Netanyahu, of course, isn't the only leader using technology to track its citizens during the crisis. In Russia, authorities are using facial recognition technology to crack down on people violating quarantine and self-isolation.  And from South Korea to Western Europe, democratically-elected governments are using digital tools to track the whereabouts of patients with coronavirus and monitor how effectively citizens are obeying social distancing measures.  While such moves naturally spark immediate fears of political overreach from leaders, they also raise questions around what happens when this pandemic is over. The concern is that as the world comes to terms with its way of life, citizens become numb to what were initially extreme and extraordinary measures. ""During crises, the window of what governments can get away with without pushback from the public tends to expand,"" says Brian Klaas, assistant professor of global politics at University College London.  In nations with strong democratic traditions, governments can be better held to account by institutional checks and balances on governments -- ensuring that these powers truly are extraordinary and subject to review. That's a little harder in countries where democratic principles have been undermined, such as Hungary. ""The problem with weak systems like Hungary is that Orban has eroded democracy for a long time and he's going to want to make this the new normal ... And he might get cheered on as he does because in crises, people look for leadership,"" says Klaas. It's not just Orban. Parag Khanna, author of The Future is Asian, explains that the ""new authoritarians that take advantage of democratic majoritarianism, such as Duterte in Asia, and Orban in Europe,"" have in recent years ""accorded themselves the right to rule by decree.""  While recent actions of these ""new authoritarians"" might seem extreme, they are largely legal and, in many cases, proportionate to the challenge of this coronavirus. Which puts the leaders of stronger democracies in a difficult position. ""Democratic leaders have to avoid any statement criticizing the actions of other leaders that might downplay the significance of the pandemic,"" says Nic Cheeseman, professor of democracy at the University of Birmingham. ""But their silence now risks handing authoritarians a blank check to cash at a future date.""  Worse, during a pandemic, strongman leaders can impose extraordinary measures in lockstep with nations like the United Kingdom and Italy, making them appear altogether more ordinary. ""The worrying thing during a crisis is that leaders with authoritarian instincts can claim to only be doing what some established democracies are doing,"" says Cheeseman. But while robust democracies are expected to eventually roll back such measures, citizens in weak democracies might get saddled with them at the behest of the leader. Of course, this ""new normal"" problem doesn't apply only to nations with weakened democratic institutions. Historically, even the United States has this century seen the executive hand itself extraordinary power during a crisis, the most obvious example of this being the Patriot Act, following the September 11 attacks in 2001.  ""If a 'rally round the flag' mentality kicks in around the world, leaders could find ways to exploit it,"" says Klaas. ""If you accept 9/11 made people happy to give up certain liberties, consider this: The Imperial study says there will be 2.2 million deaths in the US if there's no extreme and sustained government intervention. That's the equivalent of 9/11 happening nearly every day for over two years."" The example set by the US and its democratic allies really does matter. How countries like America, the UK, Germany and France emerge from this crisis will set the new bar for democratic norms. ""During crises, centralized government power is generally ratcheted up,"" explains Cheeseman. ""However, when the crisis is over, that power is not always handed back to the public and lower levels of levels of government."" These go far beyond new legal instruments a leader might wield. As we have seen in Israel and Russia, new technologies can be used that curb people's civil liberties. Israel's electronic tracking of coronavirus patients allows the Israeli Security Agency, or Shin Bet to keep, tabs on citizens by using national ID numbers and phone numbers. Netanyahu defended approving the legislation to allow this without parliamentary oversight, claiming that ""the virus is spreading at a tremendous pace, a delay of even one hour in these tools can lead to the deaths of many Israelis."" The Knesset did later approve the use of the tracking technology, mandating it receive regular reports on how the information gathered had been used. Moscow's police claimed earlier this month that Russia's facial recognition system had led to 200 people flouting lockdown rules being caught and fined, a hardline message that in a time of crisis could play well with the public.  ""We want there to be even more cameras so that that there is no dark corner or side street left,"" said Oleg Baranov, Moscow's police chief, before saying that he wanted to add 9,000 cameras to the existing network of 170,000. And as nations ramp up efforts to handle the impact of the coronavirus outbreak, large, government-funded bureaucracies will be set up, handling everything from distributing medicines and benefits to nationalizing infrastructure. Laws on criminal detention might also be tweaked to impose lockdown measures in countries. Even in countries like the UK and France, police have been given extraordinary powers to implement social distancing rules. The fear is that those technologies, laws and institutions will outlive any government of the day and be exploited for political gain in the years that follow this crisis. ""Even break clauses wouldn't necessarily help when it comes to new technologies because they don't cover infrastructure and technology changes that come into place during a crisis,"" says Cheeseman. ""Cameras that tracked terrorists were then used to track extinction rebellion protestors; legislation that allows governments to detain suspects for longer in a crisis often stays on the books."" And leaders that emerge from the pandemic on the front foot might, as Khanna puts it, not ""let a crisis go to waste."" At some point, this crisis will end and citizens around the world will be free to leave their homes. However, it's becoming abundantly clear that the world they walk into will be dramatically different from the one they left behind their front doors. And if the global population hasn't twigged this yet, their leaders already have.  ""Taking advantage of a crisis has little to do with managing it well,"" says Khanna. ""Strongmen leaders or elected authoritarians should never be confused with public-spirited technocrats ... they are very much wolves in sheep's clothing."" Global crises have a habit of creating distractions that leaders can exploit for their own power hunger. Right now, the world has plenty of power-hungry leaders. Couple that with a crisis the likes of which most of us have never seen, and it's not hard to see how this coronavirus global outbreak could be bad news for democracy, and those who depend on it. "
Carnival seeks $6 billion as Covid-19 pandemic devastates cruise industry,"Hong Kong  (CNN Business)Carnival Corporation is seeking at least $6 billion to weather an unprecedented crisis that has decimated business, after coronavirus outbreaks aboard its cruise ships killed several passengers and sickened hundreds more.  The cruise operator announced on Tuesday that it intends to raise $3 billion of secured notes and $1.75 billion of convertible notes — both due in three years — as well as $1.25 billion of new shares.  Wedbush analyst James Hardiman said in a note on Tuesday that Carnival is suffering ""a monthly cash burn of approximately $500 million"" and the fresh injection of cash should keep the company afloat for the next 12 to 13 months.  Shares in Carnival (CCL) fell 2% in after-hours trading. The stock is down 74% for the year.  Carnival is the world's largest cruise operator. It runs flagship line Carnival Cruise, Costa Cruises, the Holland America Line and the Princess Cruises brand, whose fleet includes the Diamond Princess — a ship that became a floating quarantine zone off the coast of Yokohama in February. At least 705 people contracted the virus during the quarantine, four of whom died. The Zaandam, a cruise ship operated by Holland America, is currently stuck at sea and looking for a port, after eight people tested positive for the novel coronavirus and about 200 people have influenza-like symptoms. Four older guests on board Zaandam have passed away, but Holland America has not provided the cause of death. Other Covid-19 cases have occurred on board ships operated by Costa Cruises. The series of outbreaks, along with the unprecedented restrictions on travel, work and social interaction, aimed at containing the pandemic, have been catastrophic for the cruise industry. Last month, more than 50 cruise lines suspended operations to and from US ports for 30 days due to the ""unprecedented situation"" of the coronavirus pandemic, according to a cruise line trade association. Hardiman, of Wedbush, said in a note last week that it is unlikely the industry will resume operations after the 30 days are up. Even once the pandemic subsides and people who have been hunkering down for months begin to travel and book vacations again, Hardiman warned that very few will look to set sail for the open seas.   ""Cruise travel is likely to be dead last on their lists in terms of both risk and necessity,"" he wrote.  "
I'm out of quarantine. But 'normal' isn't normal in China anymore,"Devika Koppikar teaches AP Psychology and English at an international Chinese high school program in Wuxi, about 80 miles west of Shanghai. Previously, she was the press secretary to the late US Congressman Elijah E. Cummings and a communications consultant in Washington, DC. The opinions expressed here are her own. Read more opinion at CNN.Wuxi, China (CNN)My Facebook feed bulged with post-lockdown food fantasies. Friends dreamed of a ""salted caramel milkshake"" or ""a cheeseburger topped with feta, fried egg, and avocado with sweet potato french fries."" But if there's anything I've learned after emerging from my own two-week quarantine in China, it's that we can't simply click our ruby slippers and return to life BC -- before Covid-19.Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook   I'm from Woodbridge, Virginia, and I've lived in China for four years. I was traveling in Australia and New Zealand over the Chinese New Year when I heard that the coronavirus had raged through the city of Wuhan, about 500 miles west of where I live. I got repeated notices from the US Embassy that ""recommended,"" but did not mandate, that Americans leave China.  As my return date neared, many colleagues decided not to go back until the virus madness subsided. ""Any place but China is safe,"" they said.   When I heard that everyone entering China must go through a mandatory, sealed quarantine I had a sense of doom. What if I needed to escape? How would I get food? Another expat who was in the middle of her own lockdown convinced me that it was manageable. ""You're in your own home with all amenities and they bring you food and other supplies as needed,"" she said.   I felt I needed to get back to my students. As we would not be allowed to enter our campus until we completed the two-week quarantine, I felt the sooner I did it the sooner I'd be able to get back to my regular routine. A human rights activist by vocation, I realized I was more fortunate than those who faced uncertain fates, such as refugees and undocumented workers.  I entered my 14-day quarantine welcoming it as a spiritual and psychological challenge. I chronicled my in-home journey on the Afro website, describing my life in quarantine.   On February 22, I completed my time in isolation and broke the barrier that had concealed me in my apartment unit for two weeks. Interestingly, I had not been as confined as I thought. I'd been under the impression that my door was bound by a heavy-duty, airtight tape. In reality, it was only obstructed by a simple piece of paper. The neighborhood committee -- somewhat like a homeowners' association -- that monitored my quarantine had glued this paper from the door's left panel to the frame.  If I had broken quarantine, the paper would have ripped, indicating my escape.   I have now been out of quarantine for almost 40 days -- and life is far from normal. Even though the virus hit China around Christmas and rose exponentially until mid-February, life as we knew it is just seeing dawn three months later.      On my discharge day, before going anywhere I had to go to my apartment leasing office, where I showed the committee a chart of my daily temperature readings and a medical professional checked my temperature so I could get a certificate saying I was ""free and clear"" from Covid-19.  This qualified me for a ""green"" scan phone code that I had to show before entering any grocery store or taking public transportation. That code would have turned red if I'd gone out of town or turned off my GPS. I still carry the code and show it in some places like malls, but the requirement has become more lax. Similarly, the security guards sitting at tables outside my apartment complex have become a little less rigorous about taking my temperature every time I come and go from my apartment complex   My first excursion was walking down the street outside of my apartment complex. About half the stores were open. The others were bolted shut, with their windows displaying ""Merry Christmas"" and ""Happy Year of the Rat,"" many weeks after those holidays had passed. It was an image frozen in time, waiting to melt. I was, however, excited to be able to go to the grocery store. During my quarantine I'd texted my grocery lists to the school's office assistant and the neighborhood committee brought me the food every three days. Now at least I could get the brands I wanted. But I misjudged again:  shelves were mostly empty, and I had no choice but to buy non-favorites like salted butter or sweetened yogurt. I craved a Starbucks Signature Chocolate, but the coffee chain served only carry-out orders. What would have been the point? The hot chocolate would cool down by the time I returned home and I couldn't drink it outdoors because the seating had been disassembled.     Most of my friends were still in their home countries or doing their own quarantines here, so I couldn't see them.  They also could not visit me because my apartment complex only allowed residents inside the gates. Even though I had been released from the quarantine, I was still isolated.    Then I heard that our local Italian eatery, Mammamia, was delivering. I ordered a pizza, garlic bread and arugula salad. If I had to eat alone at home, I might as well treat myself, I thought. But when the delivery people tried to enter my gate, they could not get in and my dinner cooled as I grappled through a series of mistranslations before getting my food.   Obtaining bottled water was a challenge too. In normal times, I had a company deliver the bottles straight to my 6th floor unit. Now I had to get the heavy containers myself, risking a relapse of a shoulder injury I had just recovered from. I was beginning to feel that the only advantage to ending the quarantine was to be able to throw away my own garbage.    At my school, we are still teaching online. Some restaurants have reopened for full service after receiving clearances from the provincial government. Now, Mammamia thoroughly checks its suppliers, takes the temperature of the staff and requires them to wear masks and gloves during service hours.  As a customer, I am asked to wear a mask when I'm not eating. Tables honor social distancing policies and are set up for small groups.  Malls are open, but close at 8 p.m. rather than their usual 10 or 11 p.m. to give the crew time to clean and sanitize.   Just as I thought ""normal"" was beginning to see daylight, on March 28, China closed its borders to most foreigners to avert a resurgence of Covid-19 imported from returning residents.    As I rejoice about returning to campus in the next week or so, I mourn that the saga has shifted to America.  I pray for my mother in Florida, a very social person, who must face isolation and, at age 82, falls within the high risk group. I grieve for the 3,800-plus families who must plan funerals as we speak and the 185,000 patients who are fighting for their lives. And what about my friends who work in health care? They are running out of Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) and find it hard to get new supplies.    What will ""normal"" be like when it arrives? The short answer is that it will be like a roller coaster and Ferris wheel: progress will be both volatile and slow.   First, we will have to make up for lost time at our jobs. Even though many of us are lucky enough to work online, we have had to improvise. My weekly class time with students has been sliced in half, and I've had to rush through several lessons to cover all the AP exam objectives.

Opinion: I'm out of quarantine. But 'normal' isn't normal in China anymore,"Devika Koppikar teaches AP Psychology and English at an international Chinese high school program in Wuxi, about 80 miles west of Shanghai. Previously, she was the press secretary to the late US Congressman Elijah E. Cummings and a communications consultant in Washington, DC. The opinions expressed here are her own. Read more opinion at CNN.Wuxi, China (CNN)My Facebook feed bulged with post-lockdown food fantasies. Friends dreamed of a ""salted caramel milkshake"" or ""a cheeseburger topped with feta, fried egg, and avocado with sweet potato french fries."" But if there's anything I've learned after emerging from my own two-week quarantine in China, it's that we can't simply click our ruby slippers and return to life BC -- before Covid-19.Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook   I'm from Woodbridge, Virginia, and I've lived in China for four years. I was traveling in Australia and New Zealand over the Chinese New Year when I heard that the coronavirus had raged through the city of Wuhan, about 500 miles west of where I live. I got repeated notices from the US Embassy that ""recommended,"" but did not mandate, that Americans leave China.  As my return date neared, many colleagues decided not to go back until the virus madness subsided. ""Any place but China is safe,"" they said.   When I heard that everyone entering China must go through a mandatory, sealed quarantine I had a sense of doom. What if I needed to escape? How would I get food? Another expat who was in the middle of her own lockdown convinced me that it was manageable. ""You're in your own home with all amenities and they bring you food and other supplies as needed,"" she said.   I felt I needed to get back to my students. As we would not be allowed to enter our campus until we completed the two-week quarantine, I felt the sooner I did it the sooner I'd be able to get back to my regular routine. A human rights activist by vocation, I realized I was more fortunate than those who faced uncertain fates, such as refugees and undocumented workers.  I entered my 14-day quarantine welcoming it as a spiritual and psychological challenge. I chronicled my in-home journey on the Afro website, describing my life in quarantine.   On February 22, I completed my time in isolation and broke the barrier that had concealed me in my apartment unit for two weeks. Interestingly, I had not been as confined as I thought. I'd been under the impression that my door was bound by a heavy-duty, airtight tape. In reality, it was only obstructed by a simple piece of paper. The neighborhood committee -- somewhat like a homeowners' association -- that monitored my quarantine had glued this paper from the door's left panel to the frame.  If I had broken quarantine, the paper would have ripped, indicating my escape.   I have now been out of quarantine for almost 40 days -- and life is far from normal. Even though the virus hit China around Christmas and rose exponentially until mid-February, life as we knew it is just seeing dawn three months later.      On my discharge day, before going anywhere I had to go to my apartment leasing office, where I showed the committee a chart of my daily temperature readings and a medical professional checked my temperature so I could get a certificate saying I was ""free and clear"" from Covid-19.  This qualified me for a ""green"" scan phone code that I had to show before entering any grocery store or taking public transportation. That code would have turned red if I'd gone out of town or turned off my GPS. I still carry the code and show it in some places like malls, but the requirement has become more lax.

Journalists challenge Trump's 'revisionist history' regarding coronavirus response,"New York (CNN Business)A version of this article first appeared in the ""Reliable Sources"" newsletter. You can sign up for free right here. On the afternoon of 9/11, Rudy Giuliani told a shell-shocked country that ""the number of casualties will be more than any of us can bear, ultimately."" Rather than dwelling on what the death toll would be, Rudy said ""the effort now has to be to save as many people as possible."" Those words are still ingrained in my mind, nearly twenty years later. And they apply equally well to this slow-motion attack from an invisible terror. April 2020 will be the cruelest month. President Trump tried to prepare Americans on Tuesday by saying ""hard days"" lie ahead. ""We're going to go through a very tough two weeks,"" he said during a 131-minute WH briefing, the longest of his presidency. ""In the seven years I have covered the White House, that is the most stunning briefing I have ever sat through,"" CNN's Jim Acosta said afterward. ""To have public health officials come in and try to explain to the American people that they need to come to grips with the fact -- or the very strong likelihood -- that we're going to see 100,000 to 200,000 Americans die over the next couple months from the coronavirus."" We have to hold hands as a country even though we can't touch. We have to lift up our health care heroes. And we have to hold our leaders accountable for all that they've done and all that they haven't done. The new narrative Before the briefing, HuffPost's S.V. Date wrote that Trump is pushing ""the biggest lie of his adult life ― a revisionist history in which he did everything correctly, that nobody could have anticipated such an outbreak, and his leadership alone is saving millions of lives."" This push continued on Tuesday evening. Mother Jones editor Clara Jeffrey tweeted: ""White House is now setting the goal posts at 100-200K dead as a good job. That is 2-4 times the US casualty rate in the Vietnam War."" The staggering projections are not new. They've been known for weeks. They've been reported for weeks. They just haven't been publicly accepted and shared by the White House until now. That's why Tuesday's briefing was vital — but it was heart-wrenching to think about all the time that was wasted by POTUS. I'm sure that reporters will keep pointing out the federal government's early failures and problems... But will the news coverage resonate? Or will partisanship win out, even during a pandemic? Top tweets -- Daniel Dale's recap: ""This briefing has featured a dishonest overall narrative -- a Trump effort to cast himself as the leader who stood strong against the faction that downplayed the severity of the virus..."" -- David Roberts' chilling prediction about the GOP and the pro-Trump media: ""They will frame this catastrophe as a success and their base will buy it, even as they are filling up local morgues..."" -- Jay Rosen: ""Anyone who says he now soberly accepts the reality of the pandemic. No. He switched claims. From we're doing a fantastic job, the virus is like 15 people to we're doing a fantastic job, if we did nothing it would be millions dead. Those calling him sober are the marks..."" -- Bill Grueskin: Sean Hannity ""is in Reality Mode tonight. Warning that new cases will sharply rise, young people can get sick, quoting Fauci that 100k+ deaths is entirely possible. Something really did change today...""   ""The U.S. needs to know what went wrong"" There's more and more talk about the need for a 9/11-style bipartisan commission, and more and more concern that the country is too fractured to support one. David Ignatius is out with a new WaPo column about this idea. ""The coronavirus pandemic has some eerie similarities to 9/11,"" he wrote. ""Trump certainly didn't cause the virus, any more than President George W. Bush plotted Osama bin Laden's attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. And Trump's NSC laudably tried to ring the alarm. But did the White House 'connect the dots' and take action that could have reduced the coronavirus damage?"" Ignatius said ""the last thing America needs right now is more partisan squabbling. But when we're back on our feet, the country needs to know what went wrong. The challenge, now as in 2001, is to prevent the next attack."" Chris Cuomo's new fight On Tuesday morning CNN anchor Chris Cuomo found out that he tested positive for the virus. He announced the diagnosis just as his brother Gov. Andrew Cuomo began New York state's daily briefing. Chris is feeling fine and working from home while quarantining in his basement. He said on Tuesday night's ""Cuomo Prime Time"" that his biggest concern is for his family. He fears that he might have infected his wife and children. ""That is hurting me way more than anything the virus can do,"" he said. -- Key quote from his opening monologue: ""You will have stories like mine popping up all over you in your life. You probably do already. Why? Because testing is just starting to catch up in pulling back the curtain on what we have known to be true for so long. It is not if. It is not even when. We are IN IT. This is a fight. It is going to get worse. We are going to suffer. And you have to accept it not with fear, but within almost a fanatical sense of passion to fight. Because that's the only way you have ever made it through anything hard in your life and this will be no different."" -- Here's my full story about his announcement, his brother's reaction, and more...

The world's largest coronavirus lockdown is having a dramatic impact on pollution in India," (CNN)When India imposed a nationwide lockdown a week ago, it was designed to stop the imminent spread of the novel coronavirus. But grinding this country of 1.3 billion people to a near halt has also provided a temporary remedy to another pressing health issue: suffocating pollution levels.  The world's largest lockdown means all factories, markets, shops, and places of worship are now closed, most public transport suspended and construction work halted, as India asks its citizens to stay home and practice social distancing. So far, India has more than 1,300 confirmed cases of Covid-19, including 35 deaths.  Already, data shows that the main cities are recording much lower levels of harmful microscopic particulate matter known as PM 2.5, and of nitrogen dioxide, which is released by vehicles and power plants.  PM 2.5, which is smaller than 2.5 micrometers in diameter, is considered particularly dangerous as it can lodge deep into the lungs and pass into other organs and the bloodstream, causing serious health risks. The sudden fall in pollutants and the subsequent blue skies signal a dramatic shift for India -- which has 21 of the world's 30 most polluted cities, according to the IQAir AirVisual's 2019 World Air Quality Report.  In the capital, New Delhi, government data shows the average concentration of PM 2.5 plunged by 71% in the space of a week -- falling from 91 microgram per cubic meter on March 20, to 26 on March 27, after the lockdown began. The World Health Organization considers anything above 25 to be unsafe. The data from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), part of India's Environment Ministry, was collated by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA). Nitrogen dioxide went from 52 per cubic meter to 15 in the same period -- also a 71% fall. Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata and Bangalore have also recorded a fall in these air pollutants.  ""I have not seen such blue skies in Delhi for the past 10 years,"" said Jyoti Pande Lavakare, the co-founder of Indian environmental organization Care for Air, and author of upcoming book ""Breathing Here is Injurious To Your Health.""  ""It is a silver lining in terms of this awful crisis that we can step outside and breathe."" Lowest traffic pollution Even before the national lockdown started on March 25, the phased shutdowns in India were having an impact. During the first three weeks of March, the average nitrogen dioxide levels declined by 40-50% in the cities of Mumbai, Pune and Ahmedabad, compared with the same period in 2018 and 2019, said Gufran Beig, a scientist with the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR) under India's Ministry of Earth Sciences. ""The reduced fossil fuel emissions due to (the) transport sector and slowdown in other emissions-related activity is slowly reducing the air pollutants,"" Beig said.  The nationwide curfew in India on March 22 also resulted in the lowest one-day traffic pollution levels on record, analysis from CREA said. Other dangerous pollutants, PM2.5 and the larger PM10, which are less than 10 micrometers in diameter, also dropped steeply, the report added. ""It is most likely that even the record of March 22 will be broken, and we are seeing more and more cleaner days as industries, transportation and energy generation and demand are reducing across the country,"" said Sunil Dahiya, an analyst based in New Delhi for CREA. Similar patterns showing drastic falls in pollution levels were seen in parts of Europe and China since their lockdowns, as industry and transport networks grind to a virtual halt. But this data is no reason to celebrate, Dahiya said. ""This is a really grave situation which the entire world is grappling with,"" Dahiya said. ""Pollution is going down, but we cannot let the suffering of so many human beings be the way to clean the air,"" Dahiya said.""We can only use the outbreak of coronavirus as a learning lesson for us."" Pollution protest It's a lesson that is badly needed in India, activists say. In November 2019, hundreds of Indians took to the streets in New Delhi to protest the levels of air pollution, after the city was blanketed in a dark yellow haze for several days. Air pollution hit record high levels, forcing schools to close and flights to be diverted. Other cities in northern India also suffered. Four months later, the skies are now clearing up. But the impact of living in such badly polluted conditions has left a hidden problem for residents: a potential vulnerability to the coronavirus pandemic -- a severe respiratory disease. India has one of the highest rates of respiratory disease in the world, and the world's highest number of tuberculosis cases. Such widespread lung damage could potentially increase the risks associated with the coronavirus.  ""(There are) very high levels of respiratory disease, even among young children, they have asthma, the nebulizer has become a normal thing to have in the house for families who can afford them,"" said Lavakare from Care for Air. According to the WHO, older people, and people with pre-existing medical conditions, including asthma, appear to be a higher risk of becoming severely ill with the virus. Investing in a cleaner future Globally, deaths related to exposure to air pollution are of pandemic proportions, with 7 million deaths every year, the World Health Organization (WHO) said.  Care for Air said this should be a wake-up call for India to address the problem. ""Obviously, this is not the most ideal way to bring down air pollution, but it does prove that air pollution is manmade,"" Lavakare said. ""It gives a lot of encouragement and hope that we can bring pollution down."" The coronavirus crisis also presents India with an opportunity to invest in a clean energy future, said Dahiya from CREA.   ""India (is) a highly fossil-fueled country,"" said Dahiya. ""In order to tackle pollution, we need to tackle that."" ""When we come out of the outbreak, it will be interesting to see if we invest money in the cleaner future,"" he added. ""(Do) we ramp up the old fossil fuel based intensive industries, or we go towards more sustainable options."" Lavakare said that at the minimum, the government should commit to keeping existing policy pledges. ""Governments cannot use this disruption as an excuse to go back against the gains that have been made,"" she said. ""Right now, we have a priority, we need to stop this big crisis.  ""But when things are under better control ... we need to move towards renewable energy faster. It would be really sad (if) we make the same mistake again, using coal and non-renewable energy."" "
Trump administration won't reopen Obamacare enrollment for uninsured as coronavirus spreads," (CNN)The Trump administration has decided not to reopen enrollment in the Affordable Care Act's federal exchanges amid the rising coronavirus pandemic, a senior administration official said Tuesday evening. Pressure had been building on the White House to launch a special enrollment period to allow the uninsured to purchase Obamacare policies. The decision came the same day that President Donald Trump warned of a painful two-week stretch ahead as infections continue to spread. Democratic lawmakers asked administration officials to temporarily reopen the exchanges several weeks ago. Also, two leading health insurance industry groups wrote congressional leaders in mid-March asking for such a move. ""Given the risk posed by Covid-19, it is more important than ever for people to have health coverage,"" the CEOs of America's Health Insurance Plans and Blue Cross Blue Shield Association wrote, referring to the disease caused by coronavirus. The administration's decision was first reported by Politico.  Eleven states that run their own Obamacare exchanges, along with the District of Columbia, have launched temporary special enrollment periods so their uninsured residents can obtain coverage outside the usual time frame. Open enrollment typically runs from Nov. 1 to Dec. 15 in the 38 states that use the federal exchange, healthcare.gov. Nearly 28 million non-elderly Americans were uninsured in 2018, according to the most recent Census Bureau data available. The lack of coverage has been a key weak point in the nation's fight to stem the outbreak. Americans who are uninsured may hesitate to get checked if they feel ill, which could lead to their infecting others, experts say. More than 188,000 people had tested positive in the US and roughly 3,900 had died as of Tuesday evening, according to Johns Hopkins University. Thousands more have gone to emergency rooms or been hospitalized, potentially racking up hundreds or thousands of dollars in medical bills.  The newly unemployed who lose their employer-based coverage are allowed to sign up for Obamacare policies within 60 days of becoming uninsured. "
Legendary jazz trumpeter Wallace Roney dies of complications from coronavirus," (CNN)Legendary jazz trumpeter Wallace Roney has died of complications from the novel coronavirus, his publicist said. He was 59. CNN's Theresa Waldrop contributed to this report. Roney died Tuesday at St. Joseph's University Medical Center in Paterson, New Jersey, publicist Lydia Liebman said in a statement. ""I am saddened to confirm that the iconic trumpeter and jazz legend Wallace Roney passed away due to complications of COVID-19 this morning just before noon,"" Liebman said.  ""Working with Wallace was and will remain one of the greatest privileges of my life,"" his publicist said. ""It was an honor to represent him and to be part of his musical world. I cannot even begin to express how much I will miss him and his music."" ""We are devastated,"" Erin Davis, Cheryl Davis and Vince Wilburn, Jr. wrote in a post on the Twitter account dedicated to jazz legend Miles Davis. ""Wallace was a global life force in the jazz community."" ""He was loved and mentored by Miles,"" the tweet said. ""We will miss you Wally. We love you. Peaceful journey."" Roney won a Grammy in 1994 for the album ""A Tribute To Miles,"" and was nominated for another in 1997.  Roney and Miles Davis played together at a Montreux Jazz Festival concert in Switzerland that was directed by Quincy Jones, the tweet from the Miles Davis Twitter account said. Davis died in 1991. ""Roney has long since carved out his own reputation as a true modern great. He will be missed dearly,"" said a tweet from Jazz at Lincoln Center in New York, calling Roney a ""singular trumpeter."" Roney's family is considering a memorial service ""once this pandemic has passed,"" his publicist said.  "
Police are arresting and fining people for violating social distancing orders," (CNN)Across the nation, people are under strict orders to follow social distancing guidelines in order to lower the risk of coronavirus spreading. CNN's Daniel Burke, Jeremy Grisham, Jamiel Lynch and Melanie Schuman contributed to this report. To comply with new stay-at-home orders, many people have postponed their planned celebrations, everything from birthdays to weddings. Others have canceled big trips. Theaters have closed their doors, concerts and festivals have been delayed, and restaurants have moved to delivery or takeout only. But, some people have ignored the Trump administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's recommendation to avoid mass gatherings and maintain distance from others. As a result, some local officials are cracking down. Church services In Tampa, Florida on Sunday, a large group of people gathered at River at Tampa Bay Church for Pastor Rodney Howard-Browne's services.  The pastor, who was arrested on Monday and charged with unlawful assembly and a violation of health emergency rules, hosted the services despite public orders urging residents to stay home.  ""His reckless disregard for human life put hundreds of people in his congregation at risk,"" Hillsborough County Sheriff Chad Chronister said at a news conference. ""As well as put thousands of residents who may interact with them in danger."" Howard-Browne isn't the only pastor to defy orders to flatten the curve of the pandemic. On Tuesday, police in baton Rouge, Louisiana issued Pastor Tony Spell a misdemeanor summons for six counts of violating the governor's executive order barring large gatherings. Spell, who told CNN he believes the coronavirus pandemic is ""politically motivated,"" said his March 22 services at Life Tabernacle Church drew in about 1,000 people.  ""Instead of showing the strength and resilience of our community during this difficult time, Mr. Spell has chosen to embarrass us for his own self-promotion,"" Central Police Chief Roger Corcoran said in a statement Tuesday. Louisiana has been hit hard by coronavirus cases, with at least 239 deaths, according to CNN's tally of US cases. Some models predict the state could be the next epicenter of the virus. Weddings Several people in New Jersey continued with their wedding festivities even after the state restricted large gatherings, according to the New Jersey Attorney General.   In Lakewood, police broke up two separate weddings a day apart from each other. The wedding hosts, Shaul Kuperwasser and Eliyohu Zaks, were both charged with maintaining a nuisance for holding a wedding in violation of the emergency order prohibiting large gatherings. Just days after the state enacted a stay-at-home order, another wedding host, Meir Gruskin, was charged after holding the gathering at his home on March 24. In New Jersey, there are at least 18,696 confirmed cases of Covid-19, and at least 267 coronavirus-related deaths, according to CNN's tally. House parties Police are also cracking down on house parties. In New Jersey, police broke up a party of more than 30 people after responding to a noise complaint in Penns Grove last weekend, the state's Attorney General said in a news release.  Partygoers were seen making videos and posting them on social media, according to the New Jersey Attorney General. The party host, Jacquon Jones, was charged with disorderly conduct for holding a large party in violation of the emergency order prohibiting large gatherings. The fines and punishment for violating orders differ by state.  In Maryland, Gov. Larry Hogan said that those who violate the stay-at-home order could face a misdemeanor and be jailed for up to one year or fined $5,000. In New York City, residents who violate social distancing rules face fines ranging from $250 to $500, according to Mayor Bill de Blasio. "
Analysis: Trump's alarming message portends tragic days ahead," (CNN)President Donald Trump finally leveled with America about the desperate reality of the coronavirus pandemic, warning of cruel weeks to come in one of the most chilling White House moments in modern history. Even with blanket nationwide adoption of stringent mitigation efforts, between 100,000 and 240,000 Americans could face death in the coming weeks in a cascading nationwide ordeal, according to modeling explained by senior members of the President's emergency task force Tuesday. It is in the nature of the presidency, that the commander-in-chief sometimes has to deliver grave news to the nation. George W. Bush had to narrate the horror of the 9/11 attacks in 2001. Ronald Reagan movingly eulogized shuttle astronauts after a 1986 disaster. And John Kennedy kept his nerve to address the nation during a showdown with the Soviet Union over Cuba that threatened to erupt in nuclear war. But no president for many decades has had to level with his country over such a sudden impending loss of American life in a medical emergency as Trump is now being forced to do -- after apparently coming to terms about the extent of the crisis himself.  It was not the first time that administration experts modeled the staggering possible death toll. But the combination of the President's unusually serious demeanor and the ominous curve charts of his top public health officials struck a note of alarm missing from Trump's previous knockabout briefings. The stark spectacle of a president, especially one who spent weeks dismissing the virus, warning of the imminent demise of so many Americans encapsulated the scale of the crisis. ""I want every American to be prepared for the hard days that lie ahead. We're going to go through a very tough two weeks,"" the President said in the White House briefing room. Trump's briefing mostly lacked the elements of self-congratulation and false hope that have characterized his heavily criticized leadership in the crisis. To begin with, during his marathon two-hour briefing, he mostly ceded the stage to his credible lieutenants Dr. Anthony Fauci and Dr. Deborah Birx, who convinced him of the seriousness of the situation over the weekend. There have been many false dawns when Trump has failed to match the gravity of a moment during his tenure. Past behavior suggests he may struggle to maintain his unifying tone at a moment of unique national peril. And the harrowing potential scale of the looming tragedy already have some, like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, saying lives might have been saved had Trump not spent weeks denying the severity of the approaching pandemic and adopted more aggressive actions to prepare. A multi-front battle intensifies Trump's appearance came on a day of grave developments that underscored the multi-front nature of the fight against Covid-19. Field hospitals sprang up in New York's Central Park to alleviate overcrowding in the city's hospitals. State governors pleaded with the federal government for more ventilators, and doctors prepared to make grim decisions about who will live and die amid a shortage of the machines. Fauci and Birx arrived armed with slides showing the rocketing rise of Covid-19 cases in New York and New Jersey in recent weeks, and more shallow curves for other states. Their most hopeful moments involved referring to Italy's belated turn to a downward curve in infections after weeks of agony, reflecting the wrenching substance of their message. But in order to keep deaths to the lower end of their estimates, they warned that maximum mitigation efforts -- including physical distancing and staying at home -- were imperative. Even with such a regime in place across the country -- and some states and cities are not yet taking the advice seriously -- there are likely to be between 100,000 and 240,000 deaths. Fauci vowed, however, not to accept those figures and to strive to keep the mortality curve below expectations. He said there were some early signs that mitigation efforts taken by states and the White House's distancing guidelines, which have been extended until April 30, are working. ""Whenever you're having an effect, it's not time to take your foot off the accelerator,"" Fauci said. ""And that's what I hope. And I know that we can that do over the next 30 days."" Birx called on the entire nation to unite, and, in a comment that appeared to jar with Trump's earlier rhetoric on the crisis, added: ""There's no magic vaccine or therapy. It's just behaviors."" ""Each of our behaviors translating into something that changes the course of this viral pandemic over the next 30 days,"" Birx said.  A grave moment in history As Tuesday's briefing wore on, the President indulged in his familiar misinformation and political shape-shifting that underscored his own erratic leadership and dishonesty.  Empathizing with the pain in New York and New Jersey, the President who a month ago predicted a ""miracle"" that would make the virus go away bemoaned that ""they got off to a very late start."" New York's Gov. Andrew Cuomo has repeatedly criticized Trump for not invoking the full power of the Defense Production Act to supercharge the production of ventilators and other vital gear. Less than a month ago, the President, resisting calls to shut down the economy and take the pandemic sufficiently seriously, equated coronavirus to the common flu.  ""So last year 37,000 Americans died from the common Flu. It averages between 27,000 and 70,000 per year. Nothing is shut down, life & the economy go on. At this moment there are 546 confirmed cases of CoronaVirus, with 22 deaths. Think about that!"" Trump wrote in a tweet. But now, with the number of cases of the virus in the United States racing towards 200,000 on Tuesday and 4,000 deaths, Trump admitted the two are not the same. The President invoked an unnamed friend who he said was in a coma because of the disease. ""It's not the flu. It's vicious,"" Trump said. Later in the marathon briefing -- which became more an attempt to flood the zone for political gain the longer it went on -- Trump claimed of the virus, ""It just reared up and came from nowhere."" The White House in fact had weeks of notice once the disease emerged in China. As is often the case, the President's off-the-cuff style raised questions about his tone when he ditched his prepared remarks. And Trump also portrayed himself as a lone force resisting calls to ""ride it out,"" warning such an approach could cost more than 2 million American lives. The President appeared to be setting up a political construct to use in his reelection campaign under which he can claim to have saved hundreds of thousands of lives. CNN reported Tuesday that not all of the President's advisers backed extending the distancing guidelines. The decision to shut down the previously purring US economy has thrown millions of Americans out of work and choked off growth. The full scale of the devastation is expected to be revealed in jobs numbers later this week. Trump faces an agonizing dilemma, balancing a desire to slow the spread of the virus and the need to return people to work to alleviate the possibility of an economic depression. Health advisers argued a month's extension of the distancing guidelines was necessary. But given that many hotspots may not reach the peak of their pandemics for weeks, it seems unlikely the situation will have improved sufficiently to relax the guidelines in a month. "
Fact-checking Trump's marathon coronavirus briefing,"Washington (CNN)President Donald Trump tried Tuesday to cast himself as the wise leader who rejected the advice of a ""group"" of people who had portrayed the coronavirus as a mere flu and had argued that life should go on as normal. He did not mention that he had been the most powerful member of that group. Trump's marathon coronavirus press conference included the usual barrage of specific false claims. But it was more notable for the dishonesty of the broad story he was telling -- an audacious attempt to erase the memory of his relentless efforts to suggest the coronavirus was not a crisis. Trump spoke frankly on Tuesday about projections that suggest 100,000 to 240,000 Americans could die from the virus even if people follow federal guidelines meant to slow its spread. But he also made a claim that he prevented a much higher death toll, as high as 2.2 million, by taking the virus much more seriously than some other intelligent people. ""Think of what would have happened if we didn't do anything. I mean, I've had many friends -- businesspeople -- people with great, actually, common sense, they said, 'Why don't we ride it out?' A lot of people have said -- a lot of people have thought about it. 'Ride it out. Don't do anything, just ride it out and think of it as the flu.' But it's not the flu. It's vicious,"" he said.   Trump himself repeatedly told Americans in February and early March to think of the coronavirus as the flu. At the coronavirus briefing on February 26, for example, Trump said all of the following: ""This is a flu. This is like a flu""; ""Now, you treat this like a flu""; ""It's a little like the regular flu that we have flu shots for. And we'll essentially have a flu shot for this in a fairly quick manner.""  Just four days ago, on March 27, he said that you can call the coronavirus ""a flu,"" or a virus or a germ. Trump never used the phrase ""ride it out"" in downplaying the coronavirus -- but he had expressed precisely the same sentiment. As recently as the second week of March, Trump was an advocate of facing the virus without taking drastic measures to address it. ""So last year 37,000 Americans died from the common Flu. It averages between 27,000 and 70,000 per year. Nothing is shut down, life & the economy go on. At this moment there are 546 confirmed cases of CoronaVirus, with 22 deaths,"" he tweeted on March 9. ""Think about that!"" CNN's tally on March 9 was 565 confirmed cases. Asked Tuesday about the period when he was downplaying the coronavirus, Trump said that, during that time, ""people didn't know that much about it, even the experts."" Though there is still more to learn about the virus, Trump's minimization efforts continued into late February and early March -- when it was abundantly clear to experts inside and outside the government, and millions of laypeople, that the virus was much worse than the flu and that the US was likely to face a severe problem. Trump also accused New York on Tuesday of getting off to a ""very late start"" in fighting the virus -- implicitly contrasting New York's leaders with himself. While leaders of both New York City and the state can be criticized for not acting sooner on the coronavirus, Trump himself did not even do the rhetorical minimum in January and February by urging political leaders or individual Americans to treat the virus as a major threat -- much less by urging them to take real action. And, critically, his administration was slow to take early action that experts say could have made a real difference in containing the virus before it spread nationally, such as deploying a large quantity of test kits.  Here are a few fact checks of claims that Trump made during Tuesday's briefing: Malaria drugs Trump on Tuesday again touted anti-malaria drugs as a potentially effective treatment for coronavirus, and extolled their safety, despite the lack of scientific studies on the matter.  ""It's been out there for a long time,"" Trump said of the drug chloroquine and a related drug, hydroxychloroquine. ""Very powerful drug. But it's been out there, so it's tested in the sense that you know it doesn't kill you."" Facts First: Trump is right that the drugs have been available for a while, but he's wrong to imply that they've been proven safe for Covid-19 patients. Public health officials have said testing is still needed, and trials are underway.  Over the weekend, the Food and Drug Administration gave emergency authorization for doctors to use the drugs in hospitals for a limited set of Covid-19 cases. Some physicians had already been using the malaria drugs off-label to treat coronavirus patients. The drugs have been used to safely prevent and treat malaria, and for lupus and other conditions. But there isn't scientific data proving that they're safe for coronavirus patients. There's no evidence to back up Trump's assertion that it's already known that Covid-19 patients won't die from the treatment. The drug can lead to cardiac side effects, including an irregular heartbeat, which can be especially dangerous for patients with Covid-19, doctors say. Early tests are underway now in New York, the hardest hit area in the United States with more than 75,000 cases. This isn't the first time Trump has made this comment. His messaging on the drugs have been far more optimistic than the messaging from the public health officials that have attended the daily White House briefings. Travel restrictions ""We stopped all of Europe,"" Trump said of travel restrictions his administration passed to slow the spread of coronavirus. He later claimed he stopped travel from Italy before imposing broader European travel restrictions. ""We started with certain parts of Italy, and then all of Italy,"" Trump said. ""Then we saw Spain. Then I said, stop Europe, let's stop Europe. We have to stop them from coming here."" Facts First: Trump did not issue a series of travel bans before restricting broader travel from Europe. Furthermore, the travel restrictions Trump did announce in a prime-time Oval Office address on March 11 did not apply to all European countries and contained multiple exemptions. The State Department issued advisories (not bans) in February against travel to specific Italian regions that were hardest hit by the coronavirus, but the Trump administration only issued a ""reconsider travel"" advisory for the rest of Italy and did not issue a specific ban against travel from Spain or Italy as a whole before imposing restrictions against travel from Europe overall. The broader European travel suspension applied to the 26 countries in the Schengen Area, a European zone in which people can move freely across internal borders without being subjected to border checks. While Trump initially identified the United Kingdom as exempt, additional countries that are not in the Schengen Area and thus also exempt from the restrictions include Ireland, Croatia, Cyprus, Bulgaria, Romania, Ukraine, Serbia, Armenia, Montenegro, Belarus and Russia. As of March 14, the ban was expanded to include foreign nationals traveling from UK and Ireland. The restrictions also did not apply to US citizens returning from Europe as well as permanent US residents and certain family members of both citizens and permanent residents.

Trump says it was unknown how contagious coronavirus was During the presser, Trump claimed that it was unknown early on how contagious the coronavirus was. ""The one thing nobody really knew about this virus was how contagious it was,"" he said. ""It's so incredibly contagious and nobody knew that.""  Facts First: It's misleading to suggest that nobody knew how contagious the coronavirus was. While it's unclear what time frame Trump was referencing, since late January and February researchers and health experts were warning the virus was likely highly contagious. On January 23, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention voiced concerns about the lack of information and data coming from China, specifically regarding how contagious the virus was. On January 26, China's health minister warned that people can spread the virus before showing symptoms, making the virus much harder to contain. A veteran adviser for a US health agency told CNN this bit of information was a ""game changer."" ""When I heard this, I thought, 'Oh dear, this is worse than we anticipated.' It means the infection is much more contagious than we originally thought,"" Dr. William Schaffner, a longtime adviser to the CDC, said at the time.  A day later the CDC said there was not yet clear evidence that the coronavirus could be transmitted by those who lacked symptoms, but it was a possibility health officials were investigating. On January 28, Tom Frieden, a former director at the CDC, told Bloomberg News that it was ""very clear that this is a serious epidemic"" noting that the virus was more contagious than SARS. ""So the possibilities here go from the bad, to the very, very bad,"" Frieden said. The first case of person-to-person transmission in US was reported on January 30. On February 7, a study was published in the medical journal JAMA, which found that found that 41% of the first 138 patients diagnosed at one hospital in Wuhan, China, were presumed to be infected in that hospital. The study's results indicated that the virus was very infectious. Some researchers were warning of the contagious nature of the virus earlier in February as well. Days later, on February 12 Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases warned that the US ""should be prepared for this new virus to gain a foothold"" in the country and that ""at some point we are likely to see community spread in the US or other countries."" By February 19, the Chinese CDC, in a study of more than 72,000 confirmed and suspected cases of the novel coronavirus, found that the virus was more contagious than the related viruses that cause SARS and MERS. As late as March 9, however, Trump was downplaying the threat of the virus in the US, noting that the flu kills thousands of Americans each year and that there were only 565 confirmed cases of the coronavirus in the US at the time.  CORRECTION: This story has been updated to correct the time reference to the President likening coronavirus to the flu. He began to do so in February and continued into early March.   "
"Major retailers have opened only 5 drive-thru testing locations, none available to the general public"," (CNN)As he was facing intense criticism for a lack of adequate testing, President Donald Trump announced in the Rose Garden in mid-March that the federal government would partner with private companies to set up drive-thru coronavirus testing sites.   He invited chief executives from Target, Walgreens, Walmart and CVS to the microphone and showered them with praise over the new effort. The President told attendees he envisioned consumers driving up, getting swabbed and having their samples sent off to the lab to be tested -- ""without having to leave your car.""  But the President's celebrated announcement hasn't come close to being fulfilled.  While these retailers have approximately 30,000 locations combined, the Department of Health and Human Services confirmed that there are only five locations from these major retailers that are currently offering drive-thru testing -- and none are open to the general public.  There is one drive-thru at a CVS in Massachusetts, three at two Walmarts and a Walgreens in the Chicago area and another at a Rite Aid in Philadelphia.  Almost all of the locations are offering coronavirus testing only to first responders and health care workers, and some offer it only to those who fall under those categories and are showing symptoms. CVS says that it's now making testing available to seniors with symptoms in addition to first responders and health care workers.  The retailers have shown limited signs of further progress. Asked about efforts to expand the number of locations, company officials told CNN they were working with the government. In the Rose Garden on March 13, the President hoped to showcase how the private sector, including lab companies, was assisting the federal government's effort to expand coronavirus testing throughout the country. After wrongly claiming days earlier that ""anybody that wants a test can get a test,"" Trump was under intense scrutiny from lawmakers, state officials and health care providers who said there was a lack of adequate testing.   Vice President Mike Pence, who Trump put in charge of the administration's response, also touted the effort. He said public-private partnerships like the ones with these major retailers had ""laid the foundation"" to help meet the nation's testing needs by giving a ""little bit of their parking lot so that people can come by and do a drive-by test."" Initially, Walmart announced in a release that it was opening two drive-thru testing sites in the Chicago-area to serve first responders and health care workers who have potentially been exposed to Covid-19. Two days ago, Walmart clarified its sites will test only first responders and health care workers with coronavirus symptoms. The locations are not open to the general public seeking tests. Walmart spokeswoman Jennifer Rodriguez told CNN on Tuesday that the two sites in the Chicago area ""will help us better understand the operational, public health and safety considerations associated with federal, state and local efforts to expand access to mobile testing."" ""We are in active conversations with several states to see how we can best support their efforts to expand drive-thru testing,"" Rodriguez said. ""We don't know where the next sites will be, but we are speaking with multiple states to see how we can play a role in supporting our communities at this unprecedented time."" CVS's one drive-thru location is in Shrewsbury, Massachusetts. Asked if the company was planning to open other locations or make drive-thru testing available to the general public, a spokesman said the company remains in close contact with federal agencies and state officials ""on the best path forward."" But they did not offer specifics on what that path forward is. Rite Aid's one location is in Philadelphia and also offers testing for first responders and health care workers. In addition to those five public-private partnership locations, the Federal Emergency Management Agency says there are 28 federal community-based testing sites that have screened more than 34,400 individuals. But these sites are also focused on testing only first responders and health care employees, not the general public.    Health and Human Services spokesperson Mia Heck said the federal government will ""work with partners to make testing more accessible,"" although did not provide details on when.  ""These private retailers ...have all opened drive-thru testing sites and know best how to meet their community's needs,"" Heck said. ""We are very grateful to these companies for stepping up and donating their time and resources to increase testing in Covid-19 hot spots."" "
"When you order from this restaurant, you won't pay a dime"," (CNN)It's no secret that the coronavirus has many people out of work, so a small mom and pop restaurant decided money was no object when it comes to receiving a hot meal.  Cliff ""Cooks"" restaurant in Barneveld, Wisconsin, a rural town 30 minutes from Madison, took prices off its menu in order to help those in their community struggling to make ends meet.   ""There's no money -- there are people that are not sure where their next meal is coming from and they don't have money to buy food, and it seemed like a simple solution,"" restaurant owner Clifford Hooks told CNN.   A few weeks ago, the restaurant started dissolving its LLC and changed its name to Barneveld Community Cafe UA, in order to accept donations and give out meals for free.   They never ask for donations, they just hand out the food, and if someone wants to donate they accept it. Any money they receive goes right back in to making food, and paying for other needs their customers have.   ""Are you serious?"" ""How can you do this?"" ""This is crazy!"" are just a few of the responses Hooks said he and his wife have gotten when customers come to get their carry-out or drive thru orders. ""There are people we have given gas money to as well as meals, and they are overwhelmed that someone actually cares,"" Hooks said.   The idea came from Hooks' wife, Yvonne Hooks, who has a heart for giving back.   After social distancing was enforced, the Hookses lost all their staff, so Yvonne came in to help her husband and thought there was a way they could meet a need in the community.  They are volunteering 100% of their time and resources to make this endeavor possible. Yvonne takes the calls and places the orders, and Clifford cooks.   ""I wanted people to be able to come in and get their meal ... and get their receipt and hear someone say, 'Have a nice day!'"" Yvonne Hooks said.   ""There is so much food insecurity ... especially in rural communities,"" she said. ""When I grew up, your neighbor helped your neighbor, we helped each other."" The Hookses' restaurant may not be the only one trying to help people these days, but the couple says they're proud to be helping their part of the world. Eventually, they said they hope the restaurant will become a full non-profit so they can continue to help their community. "
