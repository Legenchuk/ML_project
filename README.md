# ML_project
Final project for Machine Learning course in Scoltech

The project consist of two parts: 1) NLP part where we want to teach a model to classify coronavirus and non-coronavirus news 2) Regression part where we want to predict some economical parameters. All reqquired data are contains in folder with related names.

We obtained inappropriate results trying to predict sector's growth using changes of stocks prices. After this, we decide to explore dependancy between total employment hours in sectors and sector's growth. Here we discovered an acceptable dependancy in some sectors.

In NLP part we obtained almost 100% accuracy on validation. However, this model requires to be tested on larg enough testing set.

In addition, we have implemented NLP procedure in Matlab. There we obtained 0.99 accuracy on the same task. The code is provided in "Matlab source code" file.
